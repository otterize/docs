To support intent-based access control (IBAC), Otterize OSS starts by providing a network map of a Kubernetes cluster, using the Otterize network mapper running in the cluster.
Otterize Cloud then optionally extends this capability with an enhanced visual access graph based on the same information.

When the Otterize OSS intents operator is deployed in the cluster, and connected the Otterize Cloud, the access graph is enriched with access control information, and helps guide the rollout of IBAC in the cluster.

In this tutorial, we will:

- Deploy a demo set of services based on the [Google microservices demo](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/microservices-demo),
(a simple e-commerce application) into a Kubernetes cluster.
- Create an Otterize Cloud account, and install Otterize OSS (including its network mapper) in the cluster, connected to your Cloud account.
- Visualize the cluster network map in Otterize Cloud.

## Prerequisites
<details>
<summary>Prepare a cluster</summary>

Before you start, you'll need a Kubernetes cluster.

While you won't need [network policies](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/network-policies/) in this tutorial,
you'll use them in the next tutorial, so you may just want to install them now. Otherwise, feel free to skip that aspect.

{@include: ../_common/cluster-setup.md}

## Deploy the demo set of services

To deploy these into your cluster:
```bash
kubectl create namespace otterize-ecom-demo
kubectl apply -n otterize-ecom-demo -f https://docs.otterize.com/code-examples/shadow-mode/ecom-demo.yaml
```

<details>
<summary>Optional: check that the demo was deployed...</summary>

To see all the pods in the demo:
```bash
kubectl get pods -n otterize-ecom-demo
```
The pods should all be ready and running:
```bash

## Create an Otterize Cloud account

{@include: ../_common/create-account.md}

## Install Otterize OSS

{@include: ../_common/install-otterize-from-cloud.md}

## Visualize the cluster via the access graph

In the Otterize Cloud UI, your [cluster](https://app.otterize.com/clusters) should now show all 3 Otterize OSS operators &mdash; the intents operator, network mapper, and credentials operator &mdash; as connected, with a green status.

And when you go back to the [access graph](https://app.otterize.com/access-graph) (and select your cluster from the dropdown, if needed), you should see the following map for the demo running in your cluster:

<img src="/img/quick-tutorials/shadow-mode/phase-0.png" alt="Discovered intents" width="600"/>

:::danger
Update the image with an up to date one, and make sure there are arrows showing the direction of access.
:::

Each service is shown as a node in the access graph, while the thick lines (edges) connecting the services show access between them, as detected by the network mapper.

### The network map of the cluster

If only the network mapper were connected to the Cloud, the services would be shown without the lock icons, and the thick connecting lines would be shown in blue, because we would have no more information about what access is or would be blocked once enforcement were turned on.

The network mapper gives insights on which services are trying to, or actually are, calling other services, which already provides useful insights. We call these "discovered intents": the intent of the client service to call the server service is discovered by the attempt to call the server service, not by an explicit declaration.

:::danger
Add an image showing only the network mapper connected. Ideally it would be much smaller than the one above.
:::

### Understanding access and building confidence

The network mapper only shows information about discovered intents, not about access that is, or would be, allowed or blocked.

Because the intents operator is also connected, we get additional information, namely on access controls &mdash; in this case, only pod-to-pod access, because we have not put in any Kafka-specific access configurations.

#### Protection status

The services all show "unlocked" icons , meaning they are not protected (via network policies): that makes sense, because the intents operator is in shadow mode, so it does not protect (via managing network policies).

We also (as a default) told Otterize Cloud that there is a global default-deny network policy in place, so again, services show as unprotected.

#### Blocking status

Note that the locks themselves are green, indicating that you could now turn on enforcement without blocking any clients.

Similarly, all the thick connecting lines between the services are green: none of these client calls would be blocked if enforcement were turned on. If one were red, that would tell you it would be blocked, as you might have guessed.

But why would these clients not be blocked if enforcement were on &mdash; doesn't that mean the services they call would not be protected? Yes, and the access graph lets you know that too.

Note the red notifications on the services. Click on a service:
:::danger
Add an image of a clicked-on service that's unprotected, would not block, but also has no incoming intents so would not be protected even with enforcement.
:::
- You can see the service isn't protected now, and it's ready to tun on enforcement without blocking any clients.
- You can also see it won't be protected even after enabling enforcement &mdash; and what you need to do:
  - If you explicitly create and apply intents from the clients, they will be guaranteed access, but also the server will be protected from any undeclared access.
- So why do you need to declare intents to *protect* services as well as to *enable* clients?
  - It's the way network policies work. A service must have at least one network policy applied to it in order to be protected. That can either be a global default-deny network policy, or an Otterize-managed network policy created once a client has declared and applied an intent.

Which intents are missing? What happens when we apply them? All that will be covered in the next tutorial.

In short, the access graph will provide insights about the current access to services, and will guide you to roll out IBAC responsibly and confidently, showing which intents need to be applied to both ensure access and protect servers.

## What's next
- Gradually [roll out IBAC](/quick-visual-tutorials/visual-ibac-network-policies) in this demo, guided by the access graph, and controlling pod-to-pod access via network policies.
- Learn how to [manage secure access for Kafka](/quick-visual-tutorials/visual-ibac-kafka-k8s) in this same demo.
