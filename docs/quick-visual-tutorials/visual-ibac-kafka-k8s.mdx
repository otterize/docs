This tutorial focuses on intent-based access control (IBAC) for Kafka, specifically for a Kafka broker and its clients running within a Kubernetes cluster.

Otterize OSS configures access controls automatically, based on declared *client* intents, as we'll now see.
- In the [previous tutorial](/quick-visual-tutorials/visual-ibac-network-policies), we rolled out IBAC by declaring intents for pods to call each other. Otterize OSS automatically configured Kubernetes network policies to enable access based on those intents and block any undeclared access.
- In this tutorial, we add fine-grained, topic- and operation-level intents to the existing pod-to-pod intents. Otterize OSS automatically configures Kafka ACLs, and issues and distributes certificates to Kafka clients, so they can authenticate via mTLS and perform those operations on those topics, while everything undeclared is blocked.
- Otterize Cloud again enriches these capabilities with a visual access graph, displaying a unified view of topic- and operation-level access and protection, and client identity certificate information.
- Otterize Cloud also provides a pre-configured certificate credentials service you may use instead of running one (e.g. SPIRE) in your cluster.

In this tutorial, we will:

- Start where the previous tutorial left off: with a demo based on the [Google microservices demo](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/microservices-demo)
(a simple e-commerce application) deployed to a Kubernetes cluster, with Otterize OSS installed and integrated with Otterize Cloud.
- Add fine-grained, topic-level intents and see how access to operations on Kafka topics is automatically managed.

## Prerequisites
You'll need a Kubernetes cluster, an Otterize Cloud account, and of course to install Otterize OSS in your cluster.

If you've gone through other tutorials, you may already have an Otterize Cloud account, and have Otterize OSS installed in your cluster. But if it's installed without enforcement active ("shadow mode"), you'll want to follow the instructions below to reinstall it with active enforcement.

<details>
<summary>Prepare a cluster</summary>

Before you start, you'll need a Kubernetes cluster.

You won't actually need [network policies](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/network-policies/) in this tutorial,
so you can follow the steps below while skipping the network policies (CNI) enablement bits, or keep them as is.

## Setup the demo

### Deploy the demo set of services

We'll deploy the same demo set of services, based on the
[Google microservices demo](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/microservices-demo) e-commerce application, into a Kubernetes cluster.

But in this tutorial, we'll deploy them a bit differently, as we'll want to add certificates to each, for use in mTLS authentication to Kafka.

For the Kafka service, we'll use Bitnami's [Helm chart](https://github.com/bitnami/charts/tree/master/bitnami/kafka) configured to:
- Recognize the Otterize intents operator as a super user so it can configure ACLs;
- Use TLS/SSL for its listeners;
- Tell the Otterize credentials operator, via pod annotations, how credentials should be created; and
- Authenticate clients using mTLS credentials provided as a Kubernetes secret

<details>
<summary>Expand to see the Helm values.yaml used with the Bitnami chart</summary>

```yaml
{@include: ../../static/code-examples/kafka-mtls/helm/values.yaml}
```
</details>


Clients will authenticate to Kafka using mTLS. Otterize makes this easy, requiring just 3 simple changes to the client pod spec:
1. **Generate credentials**: add the `credentials-operator.otterize.com/tls-secret-name` annotation, which tells Otterize to generate mTLS credentials and store them in a Kubernetes secret whose name is the value of this annotation.
2. **Expose credentials in a volume**: add a volume containing this secret to the pod.
3. **Mount the volume**: mount the volume in every container in the pod.

<details>

```yaml
spec:
  template:
    metadata:
      annotations:
        # highlight-next-line
        # 1. Generate credentials as a secret called "client-credentials-secret":
        credentials-operator.otterize.com/tls-secret-name: client-credentials-secret
        ...
    spec:
      volumes:
        # highlight-start
        # 2. Create a volume containing this secret:
        - name: otterize-credentials
          secret:
            secretName: client-credentials-secret
        # highlight-end
        ...
      containers:
        - name: client
          ...
          volumeMounts:
            # highlight-start
            # 3. Mount volume into container
            - name: otterize-credentials
              mountPath: /var/otterize/credentials
              readOnly: true
            # highlight-end
```
</details>


To deploy the demo services into your cluster:
```bash
kubectl create namespace otterize-ecom-kafka-demo
kubectl apply -n otterize-ecom-kafka-demo -f https://docs.otterize.com/code-examples/shadow-mode/ecom-demo-mtls.yaml
```

### Apply pod-to-pod-level intents

This tutorial picks up where the network policies tutorial left off. We'll want to make sure all the pods have access to the pods they'll need to call,
so we'll put in place the same intents that we had in that tutorial, just in case you're using network policies. In that tutorial, we showed how you can bootstrap all those intents, by observing the calls the pods are making using the network mapper, and then exporting the network map as a set of intents files.

So let's get back to that state by applying that same set of initial intents:

```bash
kubectl apply -n otterize-ecom-kafka-demo -f https://docs.otterize.com/code-examples/shadow-mode/all.yaml
```

### Seeing the deployed demo

In the Otterize Cloud UI, the [access graph](https://app.otterize.com/access-graph) should now show the following map for the demo running in your cluster:

![Access graph](/img/quick-tutorials/visual-ibac-kafka-k8s/phase-1.png)
![Access graph](/img/quick-tutorials/visual-ibac-kafka-k8s/phase-1-kafka-service-zoom.png)

Notice that the Kafka service (called `kafka` in this demo) is shown just like any other service that's called by other services (three, in our case) acting as its clients. We'll let Otterize know this is specifically a Kafka-type service in the next step.

## Manage Kafka access with Otterize

Let's configure Otterize to recognize Kafka and communicate with it by applying a `KafkaServerConfig` (KSC):
```bash
kubectl apply -n otterize-ecom-kafka-demo -f https://docs.otterize.com/code-examples/shadow-mode/kafkaserverconfig.yaml
```
<details>
<summary>Expand to see the KafkaServerConfig</summary>
<Tabs>

<TabItem value="kafkaserverconfig.yaml" label="kafkaserverconfig.yaml">

```yaml
{@include: ../..//static/code-examples/shadow-mode/kafkaserverconfig.yaml}
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>
</details>

Upon applying the KSC, an ACL will configure Kafka to allow anonymous access to all topics.
This will be the base state, from which we will gradually roll out secure access to specific topics.

We can see in the access graph that the service is now marked with the "Kafka" logo, since Otterize now recognizes it as a Kafka broker.

![Kafka Server Config](/img/quick-tutorials/visual-ibac-kafka-k8s/kafka-service-with-kafka-logo.png)

By clicking the Kafka service, we can see its details:

<img src="/img/quick-tutorials/visual-ibac-kafka-k8s/kafka-service-info.png" alt="Kafka service info" width="600"/>

We can see:
- The `kafka` service is protected by network policies ("NetPols") and Kafka ACLs, because Otterize is in enforcement mode and managing network policies as well as ACLs.
- The KSC shows us that the default level of protection for all topics (`*`) is not to require client identity and not to require intents. In this demo, we're going to be rolling out protection gradually, so we don't pre-protect topics. But it would be easy to modify the KSC to pre-protect certain topics or all topics by requiring client authentication as well as explicit intents.
- The certificate information shows information about the certificate this `kafka` service will present to its clients as part of the mutual authentication (mTLS).

## Declare Kafka intents

In a gradual rollout scenario, where the default protection level is to allow any operation by any client, Kafka ACLs act a bit like network policies: once *any* ACL is defined on a topic, then *only* authenticated clients that have an ACL on that topic get access to it.

To see how this works, let's declare what the `checkoutservice`, `orderservice`, and `paymentservice` intend to access:

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="checkoutservice" label="checkoutservice" default>

```yaml
{@include: ../..//static/code-examples/shadow-mode/phase-4-checkout.yaml}
```
</TabItem>
<TabItem value="orderservice" label="orderservice" default>

```yaml
{@include: ../..//static/code-examples/shadow-mode/phase-4-order.yaml}
```
</TabItem>
<TabItem value="paymentservice" label="paymentservice" default>

```yaml
{@include: ../..//static/code-examples/shadow-mode/phase-4-payment.yaml}
```
</TabItem>
</Tabs>

Let's apply these intents:

```bash
kubectl apply -n otterize-ecom-kafka-demo -f https://docs.otterize.com/code-examples/shadow-mode/kafka-intents.yaml
```

Clicking again on Kafka service, we can see the results:

<img src="/img/quick-tutorials/visual-ibac-kafka-k8s/kafka-service-info-after-checkout-service-apply.png" alt="Kafka service info" width="600"/>

- The `kafka` service shows the access granted:
  - The `payments` topic allows the `paymentservice` service to perform `all` operations;
  - The `orders` topic allows the `checkoutservice` to `produce` events and the `orderservice` to `consume` events.

No other services can now perform any operations on these two topics.

That's the Kafka server perspective &mdash; and remember, no server admin had to create or maintain these access controls, they are always kept in sync with the client intents.

To get the Kafka client perspective, click on any of the lines from the clients to Kafka:

<img src="/img/quick-tutorials/visual-ibac-kafka-k8s/checkoutservice-kafka-edge-info.png" alt="Kafka client perspective" width="600"/>

You can see the exact access the client is configured to have, and trace it back to the specific intent that generated it. (You can also see that the client is actually calling Kafka, via the discovered intents, so you know the access is indeed needed.)

<details>
<summary>Optional: browse the demo to verify it still works</summary>

You can play with the demo in your browser to see it still works as intended, while everything in it is protected against unintended and potentially malicious access.

</details>

We've protected access to two topics: `payments` and `orders`.
And we've granted to their clients access to these topics by configuring ACLs, issuing certificates, and distributing them to the clients.
All this happened automatically just by declaring and applying the clients' intents to access those topics.

To continue gradually rolling out IBAC, protecting more topics while granting access to their intended clients, simply continue to declare and apply more client intents. And to see which clients are accessing Kafka, and should declare their intents, just look to the access graph, which shows the data accumulated by the Otterize OSS network mapper.

## Teardown

To remove the deployed demo, first delete the client intents:
```bash
kubectl delete -n otterize-ecom-kafka-demo -f https://docs.otterize.com/code-examples/shadow-mode/all.yaml
```

Next, remove the Kafka server config:
```bash
kubectl delete -n otterize-ecom-kafka-demo -f https://docs.otterize.com/code-examples/shadow-mode/kafkaserverconfig.yaml
```
Finally, remove the demo services and the namespace:
```bash
kubectl delete -n otterize-ecom-kafka-demo -f https://docs.otterize.com/code-examples/shadow-mode/ecom-demo-mtls.yaml
kubectl delete namespace otterize-ecom-kafka-demo
```
