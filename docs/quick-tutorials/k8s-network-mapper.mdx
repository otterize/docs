The network mapper allows you to map pod-to-pod traffic within your K8s cluster.

In this tutorial, we will:

- Deploy a server, and two clients calling it.
- Map their communication using the network mapper.

<details>
<summary>Make sure you have a Kubernetes cluster</summary>

Before you start, you need to have a Kubernetes cluster. Having a cluster with a [CNI](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/compute-storage-net/network-plugins/) that supports [NetworkPolicies](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/network-policies/) isn't required for this tutorial, but is recommended so that your cluster works with other tutorials.

{@include: ../_common/cluster-setup.md}
</details>

You can now install Otterize in your cluster (if it's not already installed), and optionally connect to Otterize Cloud. Connecting to Cloud lets you:
1. See what's happening visually in your browser, through the "access graph";
2. Avoid using SPIRE (which can be installed with Otterize) for issuing certificates, as Otterize Cloud provides a certificate service.

So either forego browser visualization and:

<details>
<summary>Install Otterize in your cluster, <b>without</b> Otterize Cloud</summary>

{@include: ../_common/install-otterize.md}

</details>

Or choose to include browser visualization and:

<details>
<summary>Install Otterize in your cluster, <b>with</b> Otterize Cloud</summary>

####  Create an Otterize Cloud account

{@include: ../_common/create-account.md}

#### Install Otterize OSS, connected to Otterize Cloud

{@include: ../_common/install-otterize-from-cloud-with-enforcement.md}

</details>

## Deploy demo to simulate traffic

Let's add services and traffic to the cluster and see how the network mapper builds the map.
Deploy the following simple example &mdash; `client`, `client2` and `server`, communicating over HTTP:
```shell
kubectl apply -n otterize-tutorial-mapper -f https://docs.otterize.com/code-examples/network-mapper/all.yaml
```

## Map the cluster

The network mapper starts to sniff traffic and build an in-memory network map as soon as it's installed.
The Otterize CLI allows you to interact with the network mapper to grab a snapshot of current mapped traffic,
reset its state and more.

For a complete list of the CLI capabilities read the [CLI command reference](/reference/cli/#network-mapper).

### Extract and see the network map

{@include: ../getting-started/_show_mapped_traffic_cli.mdx}

### Show the access graph in Otterize Cloud

If you've attached Otterize OSS to Otterize Cloud, you can now also see the [access graph in your browser](https://app.otterize.com):

## What's next

The network mapper is a great way to bootstrap IBAC. It generates client intents files that reflect
the current topology of your services; those can then be used by each client team to grant them easy
and *secure* access to the services they need, and as their needs evolve, they need only evolve
the intents files. We'll see more of that below.

Where to go next?

- You can [see a larger network map](/quick-visual-tutorials/visual-k8s-cluster-mapping), based on a demo ecommerce application.
- If you haven't already, see the [automate network policies tutorial](/quick-tutorials/k8s-network-policies).
- Or go to the next tutorial to [automate secure access for Kafka](/quick-tutorials/k8s-kafka-mtls).
- Explore how [shadow mode](/quick-visual-tutorials/visual-ibac-network-policies) can expand these capabilities.

### Teardown

To remove the deployed examples run:

```bash
kubectl delete namespace otterize-tutorial-mapper
```
