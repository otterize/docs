title: Automate secure Kafka access

This tutorial will walk you through declaring and applying intents to easily secure access to Kafka,
automating the generation and deployment of certificates for mTLS and the configuration of ACLs for Kafka.

In this tutorial, we will:

- Deploy a Kafka broker, and two clients that call it.
- Declare that one client pod intends to access a topic on Kafka.
- See that an ACL was autogenerated to allow just that, while blocking calls from the other client.
- See that mTLS credentials were autogenerated.

## Install Otterize
:::note
For this tutorial, we'll disable the network policy component, to focus on the Kafka ACL authorization mechanism.
If you already have Otterize installed, redeploy it as shown below. You can always re-enable the network policy component
later by deploying it as shown below but without the `--set` flag.

{@include: ../_common/install-otterize-kafka.md}

## Install Kafka

We will deploy a Kafka cluster using Bitnami's [Helm chart](https://github.com/bitnami/charts/tree/master/bitnami/kafka).
In the chart we will configure Kafka to:
- Recognize the Otterize intents operator as a super user so it can configure ACLs;
- Use TLS (Kafka calls it SSL) for its listeners;
- Tell the Otterize Credentials operator, via pod annotations, how credentials should be created; and
- Authenticate clients using mTLS credentials provided as a Kubernetes secret

<details>
<summary>Expand to see the Helm values.yaml used with the Bitnami chart</summary>

```yaml
{@include: ../../static/code-examples/kafka-mtls/helm/values.yaml}
```
</details>

The following command will deploy a Kafka cluster with this chart:
 ```bash
 helm repo add bitnami https://charts.bitnami.com/bitnami
 helm repo update
 helm install --create-namespace -n kafka \
   -f https://docs.otterize.com/code-examples/kafka-mtls/helm/values.yaml kafka bitnami/kafka
 ```

You can watch for all pods to be `Ready` using `kubectl get pods -n kafka -w`.


## Manage Kafka access with Otterize

Let's connect Kafka with Otterize by applying a `KafkaServerConfig`:
```bash
kubectl apply -f https://docs.otterize.com/code-examples/kafka-mtls/kafkaserverconfig.yaml
```
<details>
<summary>Expand to see the KafkaServerConfig</summary>
<Tabs>

<TabItem value="kafkaserverconfig.yaml" label="kafkaserverconfig.yaml">

```yaml
{@include: ../../static/code-examples/kafka-mtls/kafkaserverconfig.yaml}
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>
</details>

Upon applying the KafkaServerConfig, an ACL will configure Kafka to allow anonymous access all topics.
This will be the base state, from which we will gradually roll out secure access to Kafka.

```bash
kubectl logs -n kafka statefulset/kafka | grep "Processing Acl change" | grep ANONYMOUS | tail -n 1
```
You should see the following output:
```
[2022-09-13 10:58:32,052] INFO Processing Acl change notification for
ResourcePattern(resourceType=TOPIC, name=*, patternType=PREFIXED), versionedAcls :
Set(User:ANONYMOUS has ALLOW permission for operations: ALL from hosts: *,
User:* has ALLOW permission for operations: ALL from hosts: *), zkVersion : 0
(kafka.security.authorizer.AclAuthorizer)
```

## Deploy clients

Clients will authenticate to Kafka using mTLS. Otterize makes this easy, requiring just 3 simple changes to the client pod spec:
1. **Generate credentials**: add the `credentials-operator.otterize.com/tls-secret-name` annotation, which tells Otterize to generate mTLS credentials and store them in a Kubernetes secret whose name is the value of this annotation.
2. **Expose credentials in a volume**: add a volume containing this secret to the pod.
3. **Mount the volume**: mount the volume in every container in the pod.

<details>
<summary>Expand to see this structure</summary>

```yaml
spec:
  template:
    metadata:
      annotations:
        # highlight-next-line
        # 1. Generate credentials as a secret called "client-credentials-secret":
        credentials-operator.otterize.com/tls-secret-name: client-credentials-secret
        ...
    spec:
      volumes:
        # highlight-start
        # 2. Create a volume containing this secret:
        - name: otterize-credentials
          secret:
            secretName: client-credentials-secret
        # highlight-end
        ...
      containers:
        - name: client
          ...
          volumeMounts:
            # highlight-start
            # 3. Mount volume into container
            - name: otterize-credentials
              mountPath: /var/otterize/credentials
              readOnly: true
            # highlight-end
```
</details>

Our simple example consists of a two client pods &mdash; "client" and "client-other" &mdash; and the Kafka broker.

1. Deploy the two clients into a namespace called `otterize-tutorial-kafka-mtls` using `kubectl`:
```bash
kubectl apply -f https://docs.otterize.com/code-examples/kafka-mtls/all.yaml
```

<details>
<summary>Optional: check deployment status</summary>

Check that the client pods were deployed:

```bash
kubectl get pods -n otterize-tutorial-kafka-mtls
```
You should see:
```
NAME                              READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
myclient-5d9646fc46-tw5hs         1/1     Running   0          21s
myclient-other-59647b448c-w4cpq   1/1     Running   0          21s
```
</details>

Let's monitor, in separate terminal windows, both clients' attempts to call Kafka,
so we can see the effects of our changes in real time.

2. **Open a new terminal window [myclient]** and tail the client log:
```bash
kubectl logs -f --tail 1 -n otterize-tutorial-kafka-mtls deploy/myclient
```
This client should be able to communicate with the server:
```
Loading mTLS certificates
Connecting to Kafka
Creating a producer and a consumer for - mytopic
Sending messages
Sent message - Message 1 [sent by client]
Read message - Message 1 [sent by client]
Read message - Message 1 [sent by client-other]
Sent message - Message 2 [sent by client]
Read message - Message 2 [sent by client-other]
Read message - Message 2 [sent by client]
Read message - Message 3 [sent by client-other]
Sent message - Message 3 [sent by client]
Read message - Message 3 [sent by client]
```

3. **Open another terminal window [myclient-other]** and tail the client-other log:
```bash
kubectl logs -f --tail 1 -n otterize-tutorial-kafka-mtls deploy/myclient-other
```
This other client should also be able to communicate with the server:
```
Loading mTLS certificates
Connecting to Kafka
Creating a producer for - mytopic
Sending messages
Sent message - Message 1 [sent by client-other]
Sent message - Message 2 [sent by client-other]
Sent message - Message 3 [sent by client-other]
```

## Apply intents
1. The client declares its intent to call the server with this `intents.yaml` file:

```yaml
{@include: ../../static/code-examples/kafka-mtls/client-intents.yaml}
```
:::tip
Client intents are the cornerstone of [intent-based access control](https://otterize.com/ibac).
:::

2. Keep an eye on the logs being tailed in the **[client-other]** while you apply this `intents.yaml` file in your **main terminal window** using:
```bash
kubectl apply -f https://docs.otterize.com/code-examples/kafka-mtls/client-intents.yaml
```

You should quickly see in the **[client-other]** that the **other client cannot** access the topic:
```
Sent message - Message 12 [sent by client-other]            # <- before applying the intents file
Sent message - Message 13 [sent by client-other]            # <- before applying the intents file
time="2022-10-06T09:44:53Z" level=info error="kafka server: # <- after applying the intents file
 The client is not authorized to access this topic"
Loop exited
```
Meanwhile, in the **[client]** terminal you can see that the **client can** access the topic:
```
Sent message - Message 24 [sent by client]
Read message - Message 24 [sent by client]
Sent message - Message 25 [sent by client]
Read message - Message 25 [sent by client]
```
3. Verify that an ACL for this client was configured on the Kafka broker:
```bash
kubectl logs -n kafka statefulset/kafka | grep "Processing Acl change" | grep mytopic | tail -n 1
```
You should see:
```
[2022-09-13 10:44:52,803] INFO Processing Acl change notification for
ResourcePattern(resourceType=TOPIC, name=mytopic, patternType=LITERAL),
versionedAcls : Set(User:ANONYMOUS has DENY permission for operations:
ALL from hosts: *, User:CN=myclient.otterize-tutorial-kafka-mtls,O=SPIRE,C=US has ALLOW permission
for operations: ALL from hosts: *), zkVersion : 6 (kafka.security.authorizer.AclAuthorizer)
```

## What did we accomplish?

- Controlling Kafka access no longer means touching ACLs, issuing and managing and distributing certs, establishing trust,
etc.

- As we saw with pod-to-pod access, clients simply declare with their intents files the Kafka access they need,
and define a place on their filesystem where they'll get the appropriate credentials (certs).

- The next `kubectl apply` ensures that all the appropriate certs are issued and distributed,
and that Kafka ACLs are configured to reflect precisely the intended topic-level access.

<details>
<summary>Expand to see what happened behind the scenes</summary>

### One-time setups:

We configured the Helm chart for Kafka to:
* Allow the Otterize intents operator to be a Kafka super user (authenticated with a certificate).
* Use the SSL protocol for the Kafka listeners.
* Let Otterize know it should generate mTLS credentials in the Java Key Store and Java Trust Store formats, and store them as a Kubernetes secret.
* Use mTLS to authenticate clients, using this Kubernetes secret.

We configured Kafka itself to:
* Add the TLS certificates of the Otterize Credentials operator.
* Set the default ACL for all topics to allow anonymous access.

### Per-client setups:

We configured each of our clients to:
* Let Otterize know it should generate mTLS credentials for that client.
* Mount the Kubernetes secret in a local volume.

This already enables mTLS authentication between both clients and Kafka.

Then we applied intents:
* We only declared that the *client* pod (not the *client-other* pod) needed to access the `mytopic` topic.

This allowed the *client* pod its access and protected `mytopic` from any unintended access, such as from *client-other*.

:::tip Bonus tutorial
Try to create an intents file yourself for **client-other**, and apply it to allow this other client to access the topic.

## Teardown


:::caution
Take care to remove the intents before removing the KafkaServerConfig or the Kafka broker, as the operator will not know how to remove
the intents if you first make it forget about the Kafka broker or it can't access the broker.
If it's unable to remove the ACLs for the intents, the operator will prevent the intents from being deleted until
it is able to do so.
:::end


To remove the deployed examples run:
```bash
# run this first:
kubectl delete -f https://docs.otterize.com/code-examples/kafka-mtls/client-intents.yaml
# then the rest:
kubectl delete -f https://docs.otterize.com/code-examples/kafka-mtls/all.yaml
kubectl delete -f https://docs.otterize.com/code-examples/kafka-mtls/kafkaserverconfig.yaml
helm uninstall kafka -n kafka
```
