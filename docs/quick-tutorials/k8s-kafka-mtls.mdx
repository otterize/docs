title: Simple, secure Kafka access

import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs';

This tutorial will walk you through declaring and applying intents to easily secure access to Kafka running inside a Kubernetes cluster,
automating the management of Kafka ACLs, and the generation and deployment of certificates for mTLS between Kafka and its clients.

In this tutorial, we will:

- Deploy a Kafka broker, and two clients that call it.
- Declare that one client pod intends to access a topic on Kafka.
- See that an ACL was autogenerated to allow just that, while blocking calls from the other client.
- See that mTLS credentials were autogenerated.

## Prerequisites

:::note
For this tutorial, we'll configure Otterize to not manage network policies, so we can focus on topic-level Kafka ACL authorization (vs just accessing Kafka at all).

Of course you can also choose to combine them &mdash; after all, Kafka is just another service running in the cluster. To do that, reinstall Otterize without the `--set intentsOperator.operator.enableNetworkPolicyCreation=false` flag.
:::

You can now install (or reinstall) Otterize in your cluster, and optionally connect to Otterize Cloud. Connecting to Cloud lets you:
1. See what's happening visually in your browser, through the "access graph";
2. Avoid using SPIRE (which can be installed with Otterize) for issuing certificates, as Otterize Cloud provides a certificate service.

So either forego browser visualization and:

<details>
<summary>Install Otterize in your cluster, <b>without</b> Otterize Cloud (and no network policy management)</summary>

{@include: ../_common/install-otterize-no-netpols.md}

</details>

Or choose to include browser visualization and:

<details>
<summary>Install Otterize in your cluster, <b>with</b> Otterize Cloud (and no network policy management)</summary>

####  Create an Otterize Cloud account

{@include: ../_common/create-account.md}

#### Install Otterize OSS, connected to Otterize Cloud

{@include: ../_common/install-otterize-from-cloud-with-enforcement-no-netpols.md}

</details>

## Install Kafka

We will deploy a Kafka cluster using Bitnami's [Helm chart](https://github.com/bitnami/charts/tree/master/bitnami/kafka).
In the chart we will configure Kafka to:
- Recognize the Otterize intents operator as a super user so it can configure ACLs;
- Use TLS (Kafka calls it SSL) for its listeners;
- Tell the Otterize credentials operator, via pod annotations, how credentials should be created; and
- Authenticate clients using mTLS credentials provided as a Kubernetes secret

<details>
<summary>Expand to see the Helm values.yaml used with the Bitnami chart</summary>

```yaml
{@include: ../../static/code-examples/kafka-mtls/helm/values.yaml}
```
</details>

The following command will deploy a Kafka cluster with this chart:
 ```bash
 helm repo add bitnami https://charts.bitnami.com/bitnami
 helm repo update
 helm install --create-namespace -n kafka \
   -f https://docs.otterize.com/code-examples/kafka-mtls/helm/values.yaml kafka bitnami/kafka
 ```

You can watch for all pods to be `Ready` using `kubectl get pods -n kafka -w`.


## Configure Otterize to manage Kafka access

Let's connect Kafka with Otterize by applying an Otterize `KafkaServerConfig`:
```bash
kubectl apply -f https://docs.otterize.com/code-examples/kafka-mtls/kafkaserverconfig.yaml
```
<details>
<summary>Expand to see the KafkaServerConfig</summary>
<Tabs>

<TabItem value="kafkaserverconfig.yaml" label="kafkaserverconfig.yaml">

```yaml
{@include: ../../static/code-examples/kafka-mtls/kafkaserverconfig.yaml}
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>
</details>

Upon applying the KafkaServerConfig, an ACL will configure Kafka to allow anonymous access all topics.
This will be the base state, from which we will gradually roll out secure access to Kafka.

```bash
kubectl logs -n kafka statefulset/kafka | grep "Processing Acl change" | grep ANONYMOUS | tail -n 1
```
You should see the following output:
```
[2022-09-13 10:58:32,052] INFO Processing Acl change notification for
ResourcePattern(resourceType=TOPIC, name=*, patternType=LITERAL), versionedAcls :
Set(User:ANONYMOUS has ALLOW permission for operations: ALL from hosts: *,
User:* has ALLOW permission for operations: ALL from hosts: *), zkVersion : 0
(kafka.security.authorizer.AclAuthorizer)
```

## Deploy clients

Clients will authenticate to Kafka using mTLS. Otterize makes this easy, requiring just 3 simple changes to the client pod spec:
1. **Generate credentials**: add the `credentials-operator.otterize.com/tls-secret-name` annotation, which tells Otterize to generate mTLS credentials and store them in a Kubernetes secret whose name is the value of this annotation.
2. **Expose credentials in a volume**: add a volume containing this secret to the pod.
3. **Mount the volume**: mount the volume in every container in the pod.

<details>
<summary>Expand to see this structure</summary>

```yaml
spec:
  template:
    metadata:
      annotations:
        # highlight-next-line
        # 1. Generate credentials as a secret called "client-credentials-secret":
        credentials-operator.otterize.com/tls-secret-name: client-credentials-secret
        ...
    spec:
      volumes:
        # highlight-start
        # 2. Create a volume containing this secret:
        - name: otterize-credentials
          secret:
            secretName: client-credentials-secret
        # highlight-end
        ...
      containers:
        - name: client
          ...
          volumeMounts:
            # highlight-start
            # 3. Mount volume into container
            - name: otterize-credentials
              mountPath: /var/otterize/credentials
              readOnly: true
            # highlight-end
```
</details>

Our simple example consists of a two client pods &mdash; "client" and "client-other" &mdash; and the Kafka broker.

</details>

1. Deploy the two clients into a namespace called `otterize-tutorial-kafka-mtls` using `kubectl`:
```bash
kubectl apply -f https://docs.otterize.com/code-examples/kafka-mtls/all.yaml
```

<details>
<summary>Optional: check deployment status</summary>

Check that the client pods were deployed:

```bash
kubectl get pods -n otterize-tutorial-kafka-mtls
```
You should see:
```
NAME                              READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
client-5d9646fc46-tw5hs         1/1     Running   0          21s
client-other-59647b448c-w4cpq   1/1     Running   0          21s
```
</details>

Let's monitor, in separate terminal windows, both clients' attempts to call Kafka,
so we can see the effects of our changes in real time.

2. **Open a new terminal window [client]** and tail the client log:
```bash
kubectl logs -f --tail 1 -n otterize-tutorial-kafka-mtls deploy/client
```
This client should be able to communicate with the server:
```
Loading mTLS certificates
Connecting to Kafka
Creating a producer and a consumer for - mytopic
Sending messages
Sent message - Message 1 [sent by client]
Read message - Message 1 [sent by client]
Read message - Message 1 [sent by client-other]
Sent message - Message 2 [sent by client]
Read message - Message 2 [sent by client-other]
Read message - Message 2 [sent by client]
Read message - Message 3 [sent by client-other]
Sent message - Message 3 [sent by client]
Read message - Message 3 [sent by client]
```

3. **Open another terminal window [client-other]** and tail the client-other log:
```bash
kubectl logs -f --tail 1 -n otterize-tutorial-kafka-mtls deploy/client-other
```
This other client should also be able to communicate with the server:
```
Loading mTLS certificates
Connecting to Kafka
Creating a producer for - mytopic
Sending messages
Sent message - Message 1 [sent by client-other]
Sent message - Message 2 [sent by client-other]
Sent message - Message 3 [sent by client-other]
```

If you've attached Otterize OSS to Otterize Cloud, you can now browse to your account at [https://app.otterize.com](https://app.otterize.com) and see the access graph for your cluster:

![Access graph](/img/quick-tutorials/k8s-kafka-mtls/base.png)

<details>
<summary>Why do I see five services?</summary>

In addition to the Kafka service and the 2 clients we deployed, the network mapper also picked up the calls between the intents operator and Kafka, and between Kafka and zookeeper, so those discovered intents are reflected in the access graph (in light blue).

The access graph also reflects an intent that's already been applied, and was reported by the intents operator to the access graph: it's the intent which the intents operator created for itself to ensure it has access to Kafka. That's [automatically generated](/reference/configuration/intents-operator/configuration) by the intents operator when you apply the KafkaServerConfig: at that point the intents operator knows there is a Kafka service, and in order to ensure it can reach it and configure it, it declares its intent to do so. Specifically that will generate a network policy between the intents operator and the Kafka service, if network policies are in active enforcement and supported by your cluster, so the intents operator doesn't get blocked itself.

</details>

## Apply intents
1. The client declares its intent to call the server with this `intents.yaml` file:

```yaml
{@include: ../../static/code-examples/kafka-mtls/client-intents.yaml}
```
:::tip
Client intents are the cornerstone of [intent-based access control](https://otterize.com/ibac).
:::

2. Keep an eye on the logs being tailed in the **[client-other]** while you apply this `intents.yaml` file in your **main terminal window** using:
```bash
kubectl apply -f https://docs.otterize.com/code-examples/kafka-mtls/client-intents.yaml
```

You should quickly see in the **[client-other]** that the **other client cannot** access the topic:
```
Sent message - Message 12 [sent by client-other]            # <- before applying the intents file
Sent message - Message 13 [sent by client-other]            # <- before applying the intents file
time="2022-10-06T09:44:53Z" level=info error="kafka server: # <- after applying the intents file
 The client is not authorized to access this topic"
Loop exited
```
Meanwhile, in the **[client]** terminal you can see that the **client can** access the topic:
```
Sent message - Message 24 [sent by client]
Read message - Message 24 [sent by client]
Sent message - Message 25 [sent by client]
Read message - Message 25 [sent by client]
```
3. Verify that an ACL for this client was configured on the Kafka broker:
```bash
kubectl logs -n kafka statefulset/kafka | grep "Processing Acl change" | grep mytopic | tail -n 1
```
You should see:
```
[2022-09-13 10:44:52,803] INFO Processing Acl change notification for
ResourcePattern(resourceType=TOPIC, name=mytopic, patternType=LITERAL),
versionedAcls : Set(User:ANONYMOUS has DENY permission for operations:
ALL from hosts: *, User:CN=client.otterize-tutorial-kafka-mtls,O=SPIRE,C=US has ALLOW permission
for operations: ALL from hosts: *), zkVersion : 6 (kafka.security.authorizer.AclAuthorizer)
```

If you've attached Otterize OSS to Otterize Cloud, go back to see the [access graph in your browser](https://app.otterize.com). Click on the Kafka service, and click at the bottom of it to focus on it and show its details:

![Access graph](/img/quick-tutorials/k8s-kafka-mtls/protected.png)

We can see what happened:
1. Kafka topic-specific intents from **[client]** are declared (solid black inner line and Kafka icon).
2. Calls from **[client-other]** are not declared (missing "white" inner line).
3. Looking at the Kafka service, we can see that **[client]** has specific access configured (via Kafka ACLs) to perform `all` operations on the `mytopic` topic.

Since discovered intents from the network mapper don't specify what specific topics and operations clients are performing (or attempting to perform), the access graph cannot show information on what is being blocked vs allowed (red vs green). That feature is in development.

Also, the access graph shows information about the mTLS certificates (credentials) distributed to the various services, as long as [Cloud-managed credentials](/security#cryptographic-credentials) are being used. Visibility for certificates distributed through an in-cluster SPIRE is in development.

## What did we accomplish?

- Controlling Kafka access no longer means touching ACLs, issuing and managing and distributing certs, establishing trust,
etc.

- As we saw with pod-to-pod access, clients simply declare with their intents files the Kafka access they need,
and define a place on their filesystem where they'll get the appropriate credentials (certs).

- The next `kubectl apply` ensures that all the appropriate certs are issued and distributed,
and that Kafka ACLs are configured to reflect precisely the intended topic-level access.

<details>
<summary>Expand to see what happened behind the scenes</summary>

### One-time setups:

We configured the Helm chart for Kafka to:
* Allow the Otterize intents operator to be a Kafka super user (authenticated with a certificate).
* Use the SSL protocol for the Kafka listeners.
* Let Otterize know it should generate mTLS credentials in the Java Key Store and Java Trust Store formats, and store them as a Kubernetes secret.
* Use mTLS to authenticate clients, using this Kubernetes secret.

We configured Kafka itself to:
* Add the TLS certificates of the Otterize credentials operator.
* Set the default ACL for all topics to allow anonymous access.

### Per-client setups:

We configured each of our clients to:
* Let Otterize know it should generate mTLS credentials for that client.
* Mount the Kubernetes secret in a local volume.

This already enables mTLS authentication between both clients and Kafka.

Then we applied intents:
* We only declared that the *client* pod (not the *client-other* pod) needed to access the `mytopic` topic.

This allowed the *client* pod its access and protected `mytopic` from any unintended access, such as from *client-other*.

</details>

:::tip Bonus tutorial
Try to create an intents file yourself for **client-other**, and apply it to allow this other client to access the topic.

- Learn how to easily secure pod-to-pod access with IBAC using Kubernetes network policies, in [a hands-on tutorial](/quick-tutorials/k8s-network-policies) or [a more visual tutorial](/quick-visual-tutorials/visual-ibac-network-policies).

## Teardown

:::caution
Take care to remove the intents before removing the KafkaServerConfig or the Kafka broker, as the operator will not know how to remove
the intents if you first make it forget about the Kafka broker or it can't access the broker.
If it's unable to remove the ACLs for the intents, the operator will prevent the intents from being deleted until
it is able to do so.
