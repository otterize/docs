With its Kafka watcher enabled, the network mapper allows you to map topic-level access to Kafka servers within your Kubernetes cluster.
This provides a clear picture of which Kafka topics are being accessed and with which operations.
In this tutorial, we will:

- Deploy a Kafka broker, and three clients that call it.
- Discover which topics are being accessed by those clients, and with which operations, using the Otterize network mapper's Kafka watcher.

We will **not** be doing any access control in this demo, just purely mapping client-to-Kafka access at the topic and operation level.

## Prerequisites

<details>
<summary>Prepare a Kubernetes cluster</summary>

Before you start, you'll need a Kubernetes cluster. Having a cluster with a [CNI](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/compute-storage-net/network-plugins/) that supports [NetworkPolicies](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/network-policies/) isn't required for this tutorial, but is recommended so that your cluster works with other tutorials.

{@include: ../_common/cluster-setup.md}
</details>

You can now install Otterize in your cluster, and optionally connect to Otterize Cloud. Connecting to Cloud lets you
see what's happening visually in your browser, through the "access graph".

So either forego browser visualization and:

<details>
<summary>Install Otterize in your cluster with the Kafka watcher component enabled, <b>without</b> Otterize Cloud</summary>

```
helm repo add otterize https://helm.otterize.com
helm repo update
helm install otterize otterize/network-mapper -n otterize-system --create-namespace \
--set kafkawatcher.enable=true \
--set kafkawatcher.kafkaServers={"kafka-0.kafka"}
```

</details>

Or choose to include browser visualization and:

<details>
<summary>Install Otterize in your cluster, <b>with</b> Otterize Cloud</summary>

####  Create an Otterize Cloud account

{@include: ../_common/create-account.md}

#### Install Otterize OSS, connected to Otterize Cloud

{@include: ../_common/install-otterize-from-cloud-with-enforcement-and-kafka-watcher.md}

</details>

Finally, you'll need to install the Otterize CLI (if you haven't already) to interact with the network mapper:

<details>
<summary>Install the Otterize CLI</summary>

{@include: ../_common/install-otterize-cli.md}

</details>

## Install Kafka

We will deploy a Kafka broker using Bitnami's [Helm chart](https://github.com/bitnami/charts/tree/master/bitnami/kafka).
In the chart we will configure Kafka to:
- Recognize the Otterize intents operator as a super user so it can configure ACLs.
- Turn on Kafka debug logging to allow the Kafka watcher to feed topic-level client access information to the network mapper.

<details>
<summary>Expand to see the Helm values.yaml used with the Bitnami chart</summary>

```yaml
{@include: ../../static/code-examples/kafka-mapping/helm/values.yaml}
```
</details>

The following command will deploy a Kafka broker with this chart:
 ```bash
 helm repo add bitnami https://charts.bitnami.com/bitnami
 helm repo update
 helm install --create-namespace -n kafka \
   -f https://docs.otterize.com/code-examples/kafka-mapping/helm/values.yaml kafka bitnami/kafka --version 21.4.4
 ```

## Deploy demo to simulate traffic

Let's add a few services that will access our Kafka server, and see how the network mapper builds the access map:
- One service named "**client**".
- One service named "**client-2**".

To deploy these services, use:
```shell
kubectl apply -n otterize-tutorial-kafka-mapping -f https://docs.otterize.com/code-examples/kafka-mapping/all.yaml
```

Each of these services is built to periodically call the Kafka broker we deployed. Because that broker has the Otterize OSS Kafka watcher enabled and feeding data to the network mapper, we can query the network mapper directly to see the map it has built up.

```shell
otterize network-mapper list -n otterize-tutorial-kafka-mapping
```

We expect to see:
- `client` consuming from `mytopic`.
- `client-2` producing to `mytopic`.

And indeed:
```shell
client in namespace otterize-tutorial-kafka-mapping calls:
  - kafka in namespace kafka
    - Kafka topic: transactions, operations: [describe]
    - Kafka topic: mytopic, operations: [describe consume]
client-2 in namespace otterize-tutorial-kafka-mapping calls:
  - kafka in namespace kafka
    - Kafka topic: transactions, operations: [describe]
    - Kafka topic: mytopic, operations: [produce describe]
```

If you've attached Otterize OSS to Otterize Cloud, go back to see the [access graph in your browser](https://app.otterize.com).
**To only see Kafka information**, make sure to de-select the 'Use in access graph' settings for network policies and Istio policies, and leave Kafka ACLs selected, like so:
![Access graph settings](/img/quick-tutorials/kafka-mapping/settings.png)

![Access graph](/img/quick-tutorials/kafka-mapping/discovered.png)
Only the arrows between the clients and the Kafka are green, because we've selected Kafka ACLs for access graph. The other arrows were detected through network mapping, but since there's no Kafka mapping for those arrows, they are grayed out.

Clicking on a specific arrow between a client and the broker reveals which topic and operations are being accessed.

## What did we accomplish?
Enabling the Kafka watcher component of the network mapper shows which clients connect to running Kafka servers, the topics they access, and the operations they undertake on those topics.

You can consume this information in various ways:
* Visually via the access graph, where shadow mode shows you what would in enforcement mode before actually turning on enforcement, and auto-generating client intents to bootstrap rolling out IBAC.
* [Via the CLI](/reference/cli): from the network mapper directly or the cloud.
* [Via the API](https://app.otterize.com/api/rest/v1beta).

## Teardown

To remove the deployed examples run:
```bash

helm uninstall kafka -n kafka
helm delete ns otterize-tutorial-kafka-mapping
