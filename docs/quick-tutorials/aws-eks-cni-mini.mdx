This tutorial will walk you through deploying an AWS EKS cluster with the AWS VPC CNI add-on, while enabling the new network policy support on EKS with Otterize.

## Prerequisites

* An EKS cluster with the AWS VPC CNI add-on installed and with the new built-in network policy support enabled. See [Installing the AWS VPC CNI add-on](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/pod-networking.html) for more information, or follow the instructions below.
* The [Otterize CLI](https://docs.otterize.com/installation#install-the-otterize-cli).
* The [AWS CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-install.html).
* The [kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl/) command-line tool.

## Step one: Create an AWS EKS cluster with the AWS VPC CNI plugin

Before you start, you'll need an AWS Kubernetes cluster. Having a cluster with a [CNI](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/compute-storage-net/network-plugins/) that supports [NetworkPolicies](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/network-policies/) is required for this tutorial.

Save this `yaml` as `cluster-config.yaml`:

```yaml
apiVersion: eksctl.io/v1alpha5
kind: ClusterConfig

metadata:
  name: np-ipv4-127
  region: us-west-2
  version: "1.27"

iam:
  withOIDC: true

vpc:
  clusterEndpoints:
    publicAccess: true
    privateAccess: true

addons:
  - name: vpc-cni
    version: 1.14.0
    attachPolicyARNs: #optional
    - arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/AmazonEKS_CNI_Policy
    configurationValues: |-
       # highlight-next-line
      enableNetworkPolicy: "true"
  - name: coredns
  - name: kube-proxy

managedNodeGroups:
  - name: x86-al2-on-demand
    amiFamily: AmazonLinux2
    instanceTypes: [ "m6i.xlarge", "m6a.xlarge" ]
    minSize: 0
    desiredCapacity: 2
    maxSize: 6
    privateNetworking: true
    disableIMDSv1: true
    volumeSize: 100
    volumeType: gp3
    volumeEncrypted: true
    tags:
      team: "eks"
```

Then run the following command to create your AWS cluster:

```shell
eksctl create cluster -f cluster-config.yaml
```

Once your AWS EKS has finished deploying the control pane and node group, the next step is deploying Otterize as well as a couple of clients and a server to see how they are affected by network policies.

## Step two: Install the Otterize agents

### Install Otterize on your cluster

You can now install Otterize in your cluster, and optionally connect to Otterize Cloud. Connecting to Cloud lets you see what's happening visually in your browser, through the "access graph".

So either forego browser visualization and:

<details>
<summary>Install Otterize in your cluster, <b>without</b> Otterize Cloud</summary>

{@include: ../_common/install-otterize.md}

</details>

Or choose to include browser visualization and:

<details>
<summary>Install Otterize in your cluster, <b>with</b> Otterize Cloud</summary>

####  Create an Otterize Cloud account

{@include: ../_common/create-account.md}

#### Install Otterize OSS, connected to Otterize Cloud

{@include: ../_common/install-otterize-from-cloud.md}

</details>

Finally, you'll need to install the Otterize CLI (if you haven't already) to interact with the network mapper:

<details>
<summary>Install the Otterize CLI</summary>

{@include: ../_common/install-otterize-cli.md}

</details>

### Deploy a server and two clients

So that we have some pods to look at (and protect), you can install our simple clients and server demo app that will deploy a server and 2 clients.

```bash
kubectl apply -f https://docs.otterize.com/code-examples/automate-network-policies/all.yaml
```

Once you have that installed and running your Otterize access graph should look something like this:

![Access Graph](/img/quick-tutorials/aws-eks-mini/access-graph.png)

## Step three: Create an intent

Now that you have Otterize installed, the next step is to create an intent which will enable access to the server from the client. If you enable protection on the server without declaring an intent, the client will be blocked.

```shell
otterize network-mapper export --server server.otterize-tutorial-eks | kubectl apply -f -
```

Running this command will generate the following `ClientIntents` for each client connected to `server` and apply it to your cluster. You could also place it in a Helm chart or apply it some other way, instead of piping it directly to kubectl.
```yaml
apiVersion: k8s.otterize.com/v1alpha2
kind: ClientIntents
metadata:
  name: client
  namespace: otterize-tutorial-eks
spec:
  service:
    name: client
  calls:
    - name: server
---
apiVersion: k8s.otterize.com/v1alpha2
kind: ClientIntents
metadata:
  name: client-other
  namespace: otterize-tutorial-eks
spec:
  service:
    name: client-other
  calls:
    - name: server
```

At which point you should see that the `server` service is ready to be protected:

![One intent applied](/img/quick-tutorials/aws-eks-mini/one-intent.png)

And you can then protect the `server` service by applying the following `yaml` file:

```yaml
{@include: ../../static/code-examples/aws-eks-mini/protect-server.yaml}
```

Protect the server by applying the resource:

```bash
kubectl apply -f https://docs.otterize.com/code-examples/aws-eks-mini/protect-server.yaml
```
Save that to a file called `protect-server.yaml` and then run:

```shell
% kubectl apply -f protect-server.yaml
```
And you should see your access graph showing the service as protected:

![Protected Service](/img/quick-tutorials/aws-eks-mini/protected.png)

## What's next

Have a look at the [Guide](https://docs.otterize.com/guides/protect-1-service-network-policies) on how to deploy protection to a larger, more complex application on step at a time.

## Teardown

To remove the deployed examples run:
```bash
kubectl delete -f protect-server.yaml
otterize network-mapper export --server server.otterize-tutorial-eks | kubectl delete -f -
kubectl delete -f https://docs.otterize.com/code-examples/automate-network-policies/all.yaml
helm uninstall otterize -n otterize-system
eksctl delete cluster -f cluster-config.yaml
```
