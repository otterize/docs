In this tutorial, we will:

- Install the Istio service mesh in our cluster
- Deploy 2 clients calling an nginx reverse-proxy with different paths.
- Map their communication using the network mapper and the Istio watcher component.

<details>
<summary>Make sure you have a Kubernetes cluster</summary>

Before you start, you need to have a Kubernetes cluster. Having a cluster with a [CNI](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/compute-storage-net/network-plugins/) that supports [NetworkPolicies](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/network-policies/) isn't required for this tutorial, but is recommended so that your cluster works with other tutorials.

{@include: ../_common/cluster-setup.md}
</details>

You can now install Otterize in your cluster (if it's not already installed), and optionally connect to Otterize Cloud. Connecting to Cloud lets you:
1. See what's happening visually in your browser, through the "access graph";
2. Avoid using SPIRE (which can be installed with Otterize) for issuing certificates, as Otterize Cloud provides a certificate service.

So either forego browser visualization and:

<details>
<summary>Install the Otterize network mapper in your cluster with the Istio watcher component enabled, and <b>without</b> Otterize Cloud</summary>

{@include: ../_common/install-otterize-istio-watcher.md}

</details>

Or choose to include browser visualization and:

<details>
<summary>Install Otterize in your cluster, <b>with</b> Otterize Cloud</summary>

####  Create an Otterize Cloud account

{@include: ../_common/create-account.md}

#### Install Otterize OSS, connected to Otterize Cloud

{@include: ../_common/install-otterize-from-cloud-with-enforcement.md}

</details>

Finally, you'll need to install the Otterize CLI (if you haven't already) to interact with the network mapper:

<details>
<summary>Install the Otterize CLI</summary>

{@include: ../_common/install-otterize-cli.md}

</details>

## Installing and configuring Istio
<details>
<summary>Install Istio in the cluster via helm</summary>

{@include: ../_common/install-istio.md}

</details>
<details>
<summary>Create a namespace for our demo application and label it for Istio injection</summary>

```shell
kubectl create namespace otterize-tutorial-istio
```
```shell
kubectl label namespace otterize-tutorial-istio istio-injection=enabled
```

</details>
<details>
<summary>Adding HTTP request path to Istio exported metrics</summary>
Apply this configuration in the `istio-system` namespace, propagating it to all namespaces covered by the mesh.

```shell
apiVersion: telemetry.istio.io/v1alpha1
kind: Telemetry
metadata:
  name: mesh-default
  namespace: istio-system
spec:
  accessLogging:
    - providers:
      - name: envoy
  metrics:
  - providers:
    - name: prometheus
    overrides:
    - tagOverrides:
        request_path:
          value: request.path
```

</details>

:::info
HTTP request paths aren't exported in Envoy's connection metrics by default, but Istio authorization policies do support
enforcement of specific paths. That's why we add the above configuration - so the Istio watcher could observe connections
with paths included, making it easier to bootstrap intents.

## Deploy demo to simulate traffic

Let's add services and traffic to the cluster and see how the network mapper builds the map.
Deploy the following simple example &mdash; `client`, `other-client` and `nginx`, communicating over HTTP:
```shell
kubectl apply -n otterize-tutorial-istio -f https://docs.otterize.com/code-examples/network-mapper/istio.yaml
```

## Map the cluster

The Istio watcher component of the network mapper starts querying Envoy sidecars for HTTP connections and builds an
in-memory network map as soon as it's installed. The Otterize CLI allows you to interact with the network mapper to
grab a snapshot of current mapped traffic, reset its state and more.

For a complete list of the CLI capabilities read the [CLI command reference](/reference/cli/#network-mapper).

### Extract and see the network map

{@include: ../getting-started/_show_mapped_istio_traffic_cli.mdx}

### Show the access graph in Otterize Cloud

If you've attached Otterize OSS to Otterize Cloud, you can now also see the [access graph in your browser](https://app.otterize.com):

![Access graph](/img/quick-tutorials/network-mapper/otterize-tutorial-access-graph.png)

Note, for example, that the `client` &rightarrow; `server` arrow has a yellow notification icon indicating a single notification. Clicking on it shows:

<img src="/img/quick-tutorials/network-mapper/otterize-tutorial-access-graph-insights.png" alt="Access graph insights" width="600"/>

The access graph reveals several types of information and insights, such as:
1. Seeing the network map for different clusters, seeing the subset of the map for a given namespace, or even &mdash; according to how you've mapped namespaces to environments &mdash; seeing the subset of the map for a specific environment.
2. Filtering the map to include recently-seen traffic, since some date in the past. That way you can eliminate calls that are no longer relevant, without having to reset the network mapper and start building a new map.
3. If the intents operator is also connected, the access graph now reveals more specifics about access: understand which services are protected or would be protected, and which client calls are being blocked or would be blocked. We'll see more of that in the next couple of tutorials

## What's next

The network mapper is a great way to bootstrap IBAC. It generates client intents files that reflect
the current topology of your services; those can then be used by each client team to grant them easy
and *secure* access to the services they need, and as their needs evolve, they need only evolve
the intents files. We'll see more of that below.

Where to go next?

- You can [see a larger network map](/quick-visual-tutorials/visual-k8s-cluster-mapping), based on a demo ecommerce application.
- Learn how to roll out [Istio authorization-policy based enforcement](/quick-tutorials/k8s-istio-authorization-policies) using intents.
- If you haven't already, see the [automate network policies tutorial](/quick-tutorials/k8s-network-policies).
- Or go to the next tutorial to [automate secure access for Kafka](/quick-tutorials/k8s-kafka-mtls).
- Explore how [shadow mode](/quick-visual-tutorials/visual-ibac-network-policies) can expand these capabilities.

### Teardown

To remove the deployed examples run:

```bash
helm uninstall istio-base -n istio-system # Remove Istio
kubectl delete namespace otterize-tutorial-istio
```
