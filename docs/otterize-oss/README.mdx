title: Otterize OSS
---

Otterize OSS implements intent-based access control (IBAC) in a single Kubernetes cluster.
It is a fully standalone, free and open-source software implementation of IBAC built for cloud-native
teams that use Kubernetes at the core of their infrastructure.

It consists of several components:
- The [Otterize intents operator](/reference/configuration/intents-operator) that translates ClientIntents resources to
access controls using plugins, which currently include:
  - A network policies manager to control pod-to-pod access.
  - An ACL configurator for in-Kubernetes Kafka clusters to control client access.
- The [Otterize credentials operator](/reference/configuration/credentials-operator) that integrates with SPIFFE/SPIRE
to handle pod identities and manage certificates.
- The [Otterize network mapper](/reference/configuration/network-mapper) that sniffs pod-to-pod traffic and builds a network map,
which is useful on its own and may also be exported as client intents files for bootstrapping IBAC.

The Otterize OSS code base and issues are managed [on GitHub](https://github.com/otterize).

To get started with Otterize OSS, see the tutorials for [network policies](/quick-tutorials/k8s-network-policies), [Kafka](/quick-tutorials/k8s-kafka-mtls), [network mapping](/quick-tutorials/k8s-network-mapper), and [mTLS](/quick-tutorials/k8s-mtls).

The near-term roadmap for Otterize OSS currently includes:
- **Otterize SDK**: an SDK for fine-grained inline ("middleware") access control.
  - Capabilities:
    - A server-side library to authenticate clients and only authorize calls that have been declared as intents.
    - A client-side library to easily get the credentials needed to present to the server-side library when making calls.
  - Supported protocols:
    - HTTP
  - Supported languages:
    - Python
    - Go
    - JavaScript
