title: Usage telemetry
---

Operators in Otterize OSS report anonymous usage information back to the Otterize team, to help the team understand how the software is used in the community and what aspects users find useful. No personal or organizational identifying information is transmitted in these metrics: they only reflect patterns of usage. You may opt out at any time through a single configuration flag.

## What information is collected?

The information reported by Otterize OSS is defined in the [GraphQL schema of the telemetry source code](https://github.com/otterize/intents-operator/blob/main/src/shared/telemetries/telemetriesgql/schema.graphql); this is the GraphQL schema shared with the Otterize incoming telemetry GraphQL endpoint. Usage information is sent as events, each containing the event type, sometimes also a count, and some identifiers to allow correlating multiple events to understand usage.

### Identifiers

| Identifier            | Value                                                                                                                |
|:----------------------|:---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `componentType`       | Which Otterize OSS component sent the event: one of `INTENTS_OPERATOR`, `CREDENTIALS_OPERATOR`, `NETWORK_MAPPER` or `OTTERIZE_CLI`. |
| `version`             | The version of the Otterize OSS component.                                                                           |
| `componentInstanceId` | A randomly-generated UUID identifying the installed instance of the component, to allow correlating its events.      |
| `contextId`           | A hash (for anonymity) of an identifier of the context in which the component is installed. For example, for components running in a Kubernetes cluster, this is a hash of the UUID of the `kube-system` namespace in the cluster. |

### Events

| Event type                        | Meaning                                                                                                   |
|:----------------------------------|:----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `INTENTS_DELETED`                 | A count of how many intents were deleted.                                                                 |
| `INTENTS_APPLIED`                 | A count of how many declared intents were applied.                                                        |
| `INTENTS_DISCOVERED`              | A count of how many intents were discovered by the network mapper.                                        |
| `KAFKA_SERVER_CONFIG_APPLIED`     | A Kafka Server Config was applied (i.e. the intents operator will recognize it as a Kafka broker).        |
| `KAFKA_SERVER_CONFIG_DELETED`     | A Kafka Server Config was deleted.                                                                        |
| `NETWORK_POLICY_CREATED`          | A count of how many network policies were created by the intents operator.                                |
| `NETWORK_POLICY_DELETED`          | A count of how many network policies were deleted by the intents operator.                                |
| `KAFKA_ACL_CREATED`               | A count of how many Kafka ACLs were created by the intents operator.                                      |
| `KAFKA_ACL_DELETED`               | A count of how many Kafka ACLs were deleted by the intents operator.                                      |
| `ISTIO_POLICY_CREATED`            | A count of how many Istio authorization policies were created by the intents operator.                    |
| `ISTIO_POLICY_DELETED`            | A count of how many Istio authorization policies were deleted by the intents operator.                    |
| `MAPPER_EXPORT`                   | The CLI command `otterize network-mapper export...` was invoked.                                          |
| `STARTED`                         | The operator was started.                                                                                 |

## Configuring whether to report usage information

To configure whether to report usage information to the Otterize team, use the `telemetry` flag in the installation/configuration of Otterize OSS. By default, telemetry is enabled.

To **disable** sending usage information:
  - Via the Otterize OSS Helm chart: `--set global.telemetry.enabled=false`.
  - Via en environment variable: `OTTERIZE_TELEMETRY_ENABLED=false`.
  - If running an operator directly: `telemetry-enabled=false`.

If the `telemetry` flag is omitted or set to `true`, telemetry will be enabled: usage information will be reported.
