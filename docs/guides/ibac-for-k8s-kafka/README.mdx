title: Intent-based access control for Kafka in Kubernetes
---
import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs';
import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';

We can realize intent-based access control in Kubernetes by leveraging the built-in capabilities
Kafka offers for enforcement using its ACL mechanism, coupled with K8s identities Otterize can easily bake
intro mTLS certificates.

<!-- FIXME
:::note to complete
:::
-->

Of course, Otterize eliminates all of that. Let's see how.

## Choose a Kubernetes cluster, Kafka and services

You can use this guide with your own set of services, e.g. first in a Kubernetes cluster running dev or lab services,
and eventually in a staging or production cluster. You'll need admin access.

You can also use an existing Kafka deployment or use our provided deployment for ease of use.

## Install Otterize
:::note
For this guide, we'll disable the network policy component, to focus on the Kafka ACL authorization mechanism.
If you already have Otterize installed, redeploy it as shown below. You can always re-enable the network policy component
later by deploying it as shown below but without the `--set` flag.

## Configure Kafka for secure access
To configure a Kafka broker for secure access, we need to configure the broker itself as well as adding Otterize-specific
annotations to indicate that we want mTLS credential generation to happen.
For the complete list of annotation parameters please follow the SPIRE integration operator
[documentation](/components/spire-integration-operator/).

The following example shows how to configure Bitnami's popular
Kafka [chart](https://github.com/bitnami/charts/tree/master/bitnami/kafka):


1. Configure super users - add the broker itself and the Otterize Intents Operator:
   ```yaml
   superUsers: "User:CN=kafka.kafka,O=SPIRE,C=US;User:CN=intents-operator-controller-manager.otterize,O=SPIRE,C=US"
   ```
3. Configure the Kafka broker's [listeners](https://www.confluent.io/blog/kafka-listeners-explained/) to use SSL
   ```yaml
   listeners:
     - "CLIENT://:9092"
     - "INTERNAL://:9093"
   advertisedListeners:
     - "CLIENT://:9092"
     - "INTERNAL://:9093"
   listenerSecurityProtocolMap: "INTERNAL:SSL,CLIENT:SSL"
   ```

4. Set the authentication parameters to
    - Use mTLS
    - Having the credentials stored in a Java KeyStore (JKS) format stored in a K8s secret called `kafka-tls-secret`
      with a password set to `password`.
    - Deny anonymous access
    ```yaml
    auth:
     clientProtocol: mtls
     interBrokerProtocol: mtls
     tls:
       type: jks
       existingSecrets:
         - kafka-tls-secret
       password: password
    authorizerClassName: kafka.security.authorizer.AclAuthorizer
    allowEveryoneIfNoAclFound: true
    ```
5. Add pod annotations to let Otterize know it needs to generate the JKS credentials and store them at the specified K8s
   secret:
   ```yaml
   podAnnotations:
     spire-integration.otterize.com/cert-type: jks
     spire-integration.otterize.com/tls-secret-name: kafka-tls-secret
     spire-integration.otterize.com/truststore-file-name: kafka.truststore.jks
     spire-integration.otterize.com/keystore-file-name: kafka-keystore.jks
     spire-integration.otterize.com/dns-names: "kafka-0.kafka-headless.kafka.svc.cluster.local,kafka.kafka.svc.cluster.local"
     spire-integration.otterize.com/cert-ttl: "31536000" # 1 year
   ```

```

</details>

The following commands will deploy a Kafka cluster configured to use Otterize-provided mTLS credentials
with permissions for Otterize to configure ACLs:
 ```bash
 helm repo add bitnami https://charts.bitnami.com/bitnami
 helm repo update
 helm install -n kafka \
 --version 14.x.x \
 -f https://docs.otterize.com/code-examples/kafka-mtls/helm/values.yaml --create-namespace kafka bitnami/kafka
 ```
You can watch for all pods to be `Ready` using `kubectl get pods -n kafka -w`.



### Testing secure connection to Kafka

You can set up an interactive session that securely connects to Kafka by deploying a pod configured to get credentials,
and then send that pod scripts to produce and consume messages, using the standard Kafka
[kafka-console-producer](https://kafka.apache.org/quickstart#quickstart_send) and
[kafka-console-consumer](https://kafka.apache.org/quickstart#quickstart_consume) scripts:

```

```yaml
{@include: ../../../static/code-examples/ibac-for-kafka/interactive/interactive-configmap.yaml}
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>
</details>

1. Deploy a pod configured for the interactive session connecting to Kafka
    ```bash
    kubectl apply -f https://docs.otterize.com/code-examples/ibac-for-kafka/interactive/all.yaml
    ```
2. Verify that the pod was deployed
   ```bash
   kubectl get pods -n ibac-for-kafka -l app=interactive
   ```
   You should see the following output:
   ```
   NAME                           READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
   interactive-5568ff58ff-84ksc   1/1     Running   0          8s
   ```

3. Let's open two interactive terminal windows - one for the producer and one for the consumer, so we can see
   the messages sent and received in real time:

   ```bash title="Producer terminal"
   kubectl exec -n ibac-for-kafka -it deploy/interactive -- bash \
   /opt/bitnami/kafka/bin/kafka-console-producer.sh \
   --bootstrap-server kafka.kafka:9092 \
   -topic my-topic \
   --producer.config /app/client.properties
   ```

   ```bash title="Consumer terminal"
   kubectl exec -n ibac-for-kafka -it deploy/interactive -- bash \
   /opt/bitnami/kafka/bin/kafka-console-consumer.sh \
   --bootstrap-server kafka.kafka:9092 \
   -topic my-topic \
   --consumer.config /app/client.properties
   ```
4. Write any text you like on the **producer terminal**, send it with an **enter** and you will see the messages appear
   on the consumer terminal:
   ```bash title="Producer terminal"
   >Hello there consumer, this is the producer!
   >
   ```
   ```bash title="Consumer terminal"
   Hello there consumer, this is the producer!
   ```

## Configure Otterize to manage Kafka ACLs
To allow Otterize to configure ACLs for Kafka we need to create and apply a `KafkaServerConfig`.
The basic configuration allows Otterize to configure Kafka ACLs upon new applied intents and sets
a default allow policy for all topics.
We will later show how to add fine-grained control over topics.

```yaml
{@include: ../../../static/code-examples/ibac-for-kafka/kafkaserverconfig.yaml}
```

You can apply it with
```bash
kubectl apply -f https://docs.otterize.com/code-examples/ibac-for-kafka/kafkaserverconfig.yaml
```

## Setting security scope
Security scopes are set by setting topic selectors and setting permission levels.

An example configuration would be
```yaml
topic: "my-topic"
pattern: literal
clientIdentityRequired: true
intentsRequired: true
```

Topic selectors can be set by using a `prefix` match or a `literal` match pattern.
Read more [here](https://docs.confluent.io/platform/current/kafka/authorization.html#prefixed-acls).

Permission levels are set by
- **Unauthenticated** - client identity not required
   ```bash
   clientIdentityRequired: false
   intentsRequired: false
   ```
- **Authenticated** - client identity required
   ```bash
   clientIdentityRequired: true
   intentsRequired: false
   ```
- **Authorized** - client identity and an intent are required
   ```bash
   clientIdentityRequired: true
   intentsRequired: true
   ```

To set a security scope for topic access, define:
- **Default** access permission levels for topics
- **Per-topic** access permission level

### Setting the default access permission levels for topics
To set the default security scope for topics, use the following `topic` and `pattern`:
```
    - topic: "*"
      pattern: prefix
```

### Setting per-topic access permission level
To set the security scope for a specific topic, use the following `topic` and `pattern`:
```
    - topic: "TOPIC NAME GOES HERE"
      pattern: literal
```

### Example config
The following KafkaServerConfig
- Sets a default allow unauthenticated access to all topics;
- Restricts access to `my-topic` to authenticated clients;
- Restricts access to `my-topic-intended` for authenticated clients with applied intents:
```yaml
{@include: ../../../static/code-examples/ibac-for-kafka/kafkaserverconfig-my-topic.yaml}
```

It will be used in the next section as an example.

### Testing security scopes

Let's run through the example config above and check that Kafka access controls are working as configured:
- A client that's authenticated but without declared intents:
  - can access `my-topic` successfully;
  - can't access `my-topic-intended`.
- Apply intents for that client to access `my-topic-intended`...
- Now that client can access `my-topic-intended`.

You can set up an interactive session that securely connects to Kafka by deploying a pod configured to get credentials
and using the popular [kafka-console-producer](https://kafka.apache.org/quickstart#quickstart_send) and
[kafka-console-consumer](https://kafka.apache.org/quickstart#quickstart_consume) scripts.
There will be one client (this "interactive" pod) and we will use it from two different windows to get it to
produce events (from one window) and then consume them (showing them in the second window).

interactive-5568ff58ff-84ksc   1/1     Running   0          8s
```
</div>
</details>

Apply the example configuration to Kafka:
```bash
kubectl apply -f https://docs.otterize.com/code-examples/ibac-for-kafka/kafkaserverconfig-my-topic.yaml
```

#### Access `my-topic` successfully

Let's open two interactive terminal windows &mdash;
one scripted to produce events to `my-topic` and one to consume and show events from `my-topic` &mdash;
so we can see the messages sent and received in real time:

```bash title="Producer terminal"
kubectl exec -n ibac-for-kafka -it deploy/interactive -- bash \
/opt/bitnami/kafka/bin/kafka-console-producer.sh \
--bootstrap-server kafka.kafka:9092 \
-topic my-topic \
--producer.config /app/client.properties
```

```bash title="Consumer terminal"
kubectl exec -n ibac-for-kafka -it deploy/interactive -- bash \
/opt/bitnami/kafka/bin/kafka-console-consumer.sh \
--bootstrap-server kafka.kafka:9092 \
-topic my-topic \
--consumer.config /app/client.properties
```

Type some text in the **producer terminal**, send it with an **enter**, and look for the message to appear
in the **consumer terminal**:
```bash title="Producer terminal"
>Hello there consumer, this is the producer!
>
```
```bash title="Consumer terminal"
Hello there consumer, this is the producer!
```

Sure enough, all that the client (pod) needed in order to access `my-topic` were the mTLS credentials
(configured and distributed by Otterize) because that topic was configured as only requiring authentication.

You can now close the two terminal windows.

#### Fail to access `my-topic-intended`

We will now test the behavior with two **new** interactive terminal windows, now scripted to access `my-topic-intended`.

Start by opening the **producer terminal**:
```bash title="Producer terminal"
kubectl exec -n ibac-for-kafka -it deploy/interactive -- bash \
/opt/bitnami/kafka/bin/kafka-console-producer.sh \
--bootstrap-server kafka.kafka:9092 \
-topic my-topic-intended \
--producer.config /app/client.properties
```

Type `hello` into the **producer terminal** and you will see it getting blocked from accessing the `my-topic-intended`:
```bash title="Producer terminal"
>hello
[2022-09-15 10:12:24,926] WARN [Producer clientId=console-producer] Error while fetching metadata with correlation id 4 : {my-topic-intended=TOPIC_AUTHORIZATION_FAILED} (org.apache.kafka.clients.NetworkClient)
[2022-09-15 10:12:24,936] ERROR [Producer clientId=console-producer] Topic authorization failed for topics [my-topic-intended] (org.apache.kafka.clients.Metadata)
[2022-09-15 10:12:24,941] ERROR Error when sending message to topic my-topic-intended with key: null, value: 5 bytes with error: (org.apache.kafka.clients.producer.internals.ErrorLoggingCallback)
org.apache.kafka.common.errors.TopicAuthorizationException: Not authorized to access topics: [my-topic-intended]
```

Open the **consumer terminal** with:
```bash title="Consumer terminal"
kubectl exec -n ibac-for-kafka -it deploy/interactive -- bash \
/opt/bitnami/kafka/bin/kafka-console-consumer.sh \
--bootstrap-server kafka.kafka:9092 \
-topic my-topic-intended \
--consumer.config /app/client.properties
```

Notice that it immediately fails to consume `my-topic-intended` as following:
```bash
[2022-09-15 10:12:14,822] WARN [Consumer clientId=console-consumer, groupId=console-consumer-40186] Error while fetching metadata with correlation id 2 : {my-topic-intended=TOPIC_AUTHORIZATION_FAILED} (org.apache.kafka.clients.NetworkClient)
[2022-09-15 10:12:14,824] ERROR [Consumer clientId=console-consumer, groupId=console-consumer-40186] Topic authorization failed for topics [my-topic-intended] (org.apache.kafka.clients.Metadata)
[2022-09-15 10:12:14,825] ERROR Error processing message, terminating consumer process:  (kafka.tools.ConsoleConsumer$)
org.apache.kafka.common.errors.TopicAuthorizationException: Not authorized to access topics: [my-topic-intended]
Processed a total of 0 messages
```

While the client (pod) had credentials, it was not authorized to access this topic, as it didn't declare
intents to do so, and this topic was configured to require authorization.

You can again close the two terminal windows.

#### Declare and apply client intents to access `my-topic-intended`

Now we'll declare the client's intents to access `my-topic-intended`:
```yaml
{@include: ../../../static/code-examples/ibac-for-kafka/interactive/interactive-intents.yaml}
```
Apply these intents with:
```bash
kubectl apply -f https://docs.otterize.com/code-examples/ibac-for-kafka/interactive/interactive-intents.yaml
```

#### Access `my-topic-intended` successfully

Finally, let's again open two interactive terminal windows scripted to access `my-topic-intended`:

```bash title="Producer terminal"
kubectl exec -n ibac-for-kafka -it deploy/interactive -- bash \
/opt/bitnami/kafka/bin/kafka-console-producer.sh \
--bootstrap-server kafka.kafka:9092 \
-topic my-topic-intended \
--producer.config /app/client.properties
```

```bash title="Consumer terminal"
kubectl exec -n ibac-for-kafka -it deploy/interactive -- bash \
/opt/bitnami/kafka/bin/kafka-console-consumer.sh \
--bootstrap-server kafka.kafka:9092 \
-topic my-topic-intended \
--consumer.config /app/client.properties
```

Type some text in the **producer terminal**, send it with an **enter**, and watch the two windows:
```bash title="Producer terminal"
>Hello there consumer, this is the producer!
>
   ```
```bash title="Consumer terminal"
Hello there consumer, this is the producer!
   ```

Now that the client has declared its intents, and those intents were applied to the cluster, Otterize
configured the Kafka ACLs to permit this client to successfully access the `my-topic-intended` topic.

You can now close the two terminal windows.

### What happens when we apply a security scope
Security scopes translate directly into Kafka ACLs.
You can use the parameters `topic`, `pattern`, `clientIdentityRequired` and `intentsRequired` to configure them.
With those, you can choose on which topics you'd like to require an identity (enforce mTLS),
on which you'd like to require intents,
and on which you don't require any of those.
[Read more about Kafka configuration here.](/components/intents-operator/configuration).

## Configuring intents
### Common use cases
Client intents can be configured to allow different access patterns for different clients.
A basic intents file for a client intending to **produce** to a topic looks as follows.

```yaml
apiVersion: k8s.otterize.com/v1alpha1
kind: ClientIntents
metadata:
  name: myclient
spec:
  service:
    name: myclient
  calls:
    - name: kafka
      namespace: kafka
      type: kafka
      topics:
        - name: mytopic
          operations: [ produce ]
```

To configure a different access pattern for the client we need to set its **operation** field to the desired value.

Common access patterns
- **all** - allow all operations for the topic.
```yaml
- name: mytopic
  operations: [ all ]
```
- **produce** - allow the *produce* access pattern for a topic.
```yaml
- name: mytopic
  operations: [ produce ]
```
- **consume** - allow the *consume* access pattern for a topic.
```yaml
- name: mytopic
  operations: [ consume ]
```
- **produce and create** - allow the *produce* and *create* access pattern for a topic.
```yaml
- name: mytopic
  operations: [ create, produce ]
```

### All options
Available topic operations are as follows. For more details read [here](https://docs.confluent.io/platform/current/kafka/authorization.html#operations)

| option            | Operation       |
|-------------------|-----------------|
| `all`             | All             |
| `consume`         | Read            |
| `produce`         | Write           |
| `create`          | Create          |
| `alter`           | Alter           |
| `delete`          | Delete          |
| `describe`        | Describe        |
| `ClusterAction`   | ClusterAction   |
| `DescribeConfigs` | DescribeConfigs |
| `AlterConfigs`    | AlterConfigs    |
| `IdempotentWrite` | IdempotentWrite |

## Otterize identities, intents and Kafka ACLs
In the following example, there is one client (`myclient`) running in the namespace `ibac-for-kafka`
and an intent to access a single topic (`my-topic`).

### Generating credentials
By annotating the pod with `spire-integration.otterize.com/tls-secret-name: myclient-credentials-secret` Otterize
automatically generates mTLS credentials for the pod.

The certificate's `CN` is set to be `myclient.ibac-for-kafka`. This is determined by taking the [Otterize service name](/service-identities) and appending the namespace. This value will be used in the
following step when applying intents.

You can deploy the client with:
```bash
kubectl apply -f https://docs.otterize.com/code-examples/ibac-for-kafka/client-deployment.yaml
```
Run the following to inspect its certificate:
```bash
kubectl get secret -n ibac-for-kafka myclient-credentials-secret -o jsonpath='{.data.svid\.pem}' | \
base64 -d | openssl x509 -in svid.pem -text | grep "CN"
```
You should see the `CN` configured correctly
```bash
  Subject: C = US, O = SPIRE, CN = client.otterize-tutorial-mtls
```

### Applying intents

When an intent is applied &mdash; in our case, for `myclient` to access `my-topic` on Kafka &mdash; Otterize automatically
generates an ACL:
- the ACL matches the `CN` value used for this client: `myclient.ibac-for-kafka`;
- the ACL allow access to the intended topic with the intended operation.

You can apply the intents with:
```bash
kubectl apply -f https://docs.otterize.com/code-examples/ibac-for-kafka/client-intents.yaml
```
Run the following command to look through the Kafka logs for ACL changes:
```bash
kubectl logs -n kafka statefulset/kafka | grep "Processing Acl change" | grep myclient | tail -n 1
```
You should see that a Kafka ACL was configured to allow access to `my-topic` for `myclient.ibac-for-kafka`:
```bash
[2022-09-15 07:41:12,632] INFO Processing Acl change notification for
ResourcePattern(resourceType=TOPIC, name=my-topic, patternType=LITERAL), versionedAcls :
Set(User:ANONYMOUS has DENY permission for operations: ALL from hosts: *,
    User:CN=myclient.ibac-for-kafka,O=SPIRE,C=US has ALLOW permission for operations: ALL from hosts: *)
, zkVersion : 5 (kafka.security.authorizer.AclAuthorizer)
```




## Teardown
To remove the deployed examples run:
```bash
kubectl delete namespace ibac-for-kafka
```
