If you don't already have an account, browse to [https://app.otterize.com](https://app.otterize.com) to set one up.

If someone in your team has already created an org in Otterize Cloud, and invited you (using your email address), you may see an invitation to accept.

Otherwise, you'll create a new org, which you can later rename, and invite your teammates to join you there.
