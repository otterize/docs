You'll need [Helm](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/) installed on your machine to install Otterize as follows:

   ```shell
   helm repo add otterize https://helm.otterize.com
   helm repo update
   helm install otterize otterize/otterize-kubernetes -n otterize-system --create-namespace --set networkMapper.istiowatcher.enable=true
   ```

This chart is a bundle of the Otterize intents operator, Otterize credentials operator, Otterize network mapper with the Istio watcher componenet enabled, and SPIRE.
Initial deployment may take a couple of minutes.
You can add the `--wait` flag for Helm to wait for deployment to complete and all pods to be Ready, or manually watch for all pods to be `Ready` using `kubectl get pods -n otterize-system -w`.

After all the pods are ready you should see the following (or similar) in your terminal when you run `kubectl get pods -n otterize-system`:

``` bash
