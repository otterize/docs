title: Service identities and resolution
---

Otterize uses universal service identities to refer to services, regardless of which infrastructure they run on. Every service has a name, and possibly a namespace, which is specified in Otterize client intents to request access to other services.

## Kubernetes service identity resolution
How do Otterize operators decide what is the name of the service that runs within the pod? The algorithm is as follows:

1. If the pod has an `otterize/service-name` label, its value is used as the service name. This allows developers and
   automations to explicitly name services, if needed.
2. If there is no `otterize/service-name` label, a recursive look up is performed for the Kubernetes resource owner of
   the pod, until the root resource is reached, and its name is used as the service name. For example, if you have
   a `Deployment` named `checkoutservice`, which then creates and owns a `ReplicaSet`, which then creates and owns
   a `Pod`, then the service name for that pod is `checkoutservice` - same as the name of the `Deployment`. This is
   intended to capture the likely-more-meaningful "human name" of the service.
