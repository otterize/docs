# AWS Visibility Integration

Otterize can collect metadata on your AWS resources so to recognize and differentiate traffic your workloads are making to your own AWS hosted services.

### What it does / How does it differ from AWS IAM?

While AWS IAM lets you secure (authenticate, monitor, enforce policies) the access of your EKS workloads to AWS API (Upload a file to S3, make a call to Lambda function, etc...),
AWS Visibility helps you recognize egress traffic to your own services that *"happen to be"* hosted on AWS.

If your cluster is making calls to `another-api.yourcompany.com` which points to another EKS cluster's Ingress (through a LB), or to `some-db.yourcompany.com` which is an alias to an external RDS endpoint,
AWS Visibility will make sure those calls are made visible as edges in your access graph, rather than registering as generic egress internet traffic.

### How does it work?

Unlike AWS IAM, AWS Visibility doesn't require installing additional components as part of provisioning Otterize on your cluster.
It merely requires an IAM Role in your AWS account (with some very limited read-only permissions) to be assumed by Otterize Cloud.
This role is created in your account using a CloudFormation template to which you'll be redirected after you create a new AWS Visibility integration through our web app.
(Alternatively, [this](https://registry.terraform.io/modules/otterize/otterize-aws-visibility/aws/latest) Terraform module can be used).
Once the integration is created, Otterize Cloud will start to periodically collect metadata on your publicly (or privately) exposed AWS resources.
Each integration would be associated with a single AWS account (you can create multiple integrations for multiple accounts), and for each a list of relevant regions to monitor should be configured.
