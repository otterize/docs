# PostgreSQL

Otterize enables secure and efficient access to your PostgreSQL database, regardless of where it's located, from within your Kubernetes environment. By utilizing [Intent-Based Access Control](/overview/intent-based-access-control) (IBAC), Otterize creates just-in-time username-and-password pairs for your workloads, delivering them as Kubernetes Secrets that can be mounted to files or mapped to environment variables, as well as `GRANT`ing access to databases and tables based on these declarations. Additionally, Otterize can automatically generate IBAC declarations (`ClientIntents`) by analyzing your database access patterns, determining which workloads are accessing which databases, tables, and the specific operations they're performing.

## How Otterize Manages Database Access

Otterize manages database access through two specialized components:

**Credentials Operator**: This component creates and manages Kubernetes Secrets containing username-and-password pairs for your workloads. It ensures these credentials are synchronized with your PostgreSQL database, even performing password rotations if configured. The Credentials Operator establishes a connection to your database using the credentials provided in the `PostgreSQLServerConfig`, even if password rotation is not enabled, to set up the initial user credentials.

**Intents Operator**: This component is responsible for applying `GRANTs` and `REVOKEs` to database objects based on your ClientIntents declarations. It ensures that your workloads have the precise level of access required and nothing more. The Intents Operator also connects to your PostgreSQL database using the same credentials as the Credentials Operator.

## Required Database Permissions for otterize

Both the Credentials and Intents Operators require specific permissions within your PostgreSQL database to function correctly. It is recommended to provide a user with administrative privileges or a dedicated user with the following privileges on the relevant schemas:

```sql
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON ALL TABLES IN SCHEMA <your_schema>;
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON ALL SEQUENCES IN SCHEMA <your_schema>;
```

:::note
The root or privileged account in your database is used exclusively by the Otterize operator during the initial setup phase. It is used to create dedicated users for your workloads and to manage their permissions. Your workloads themselves do not use or have access to the root account's credentials.

### How does Otterize work with PostgreSQL?

The Otterize credentials operator will create a unique PostgreSQL username-password combination for each workload's use, exposed via a Kubernetes Secret. The workload will use these credentials to connect to the database. `ClientIntents` will define the access required by that workload. As the intents are applied, The Otterize intents operator will keep the database's list of users and GRANTs up to date so that the workload is able to access it.

1. To get started, your cluster must have Otterize deployed.
2. You'll need to create a `PostgreSQLServerConfig` in your cluster, providing a connection URL and admin-level credentials for Otterize to manage permissions in your database. Below is an example `PostgreSQLServerConfig` resource.

```yaml
apiVersion: k8s.otterize.com/v2beta1
kind: PostgreSQLServerConfig
metadata:
  name: postgres-tutorial-db # database instance name - should match the target in ClientIntents
  namespace: otterize-tutorial-postgres
spec:
  address: <PGHOST:PGPORT> # Your Postgres address
  credentials:
    # Username Otterize will connect with & configure permissions as; optional, can be omitted if using a secretRef
    username: <PGUSER>
    # Password for the above username; optional, can be omitted if using a secretRef
    password: <PGPASSWORD>
    # Secret containing the database credentials; optional, can be omitted if using the above username & password fields
    secretRef:
      # Name of the secret containing the database credentials; required
      name: postgres-credentials
      # Namespace where the secret is stored; optional, defaults to the namespace of the PostgreSQLServerConfig
      namespace: otterize-tutorial-postgres
      # Key in the secret containing the username; optional, defaults to 'username'
      usernameKey: username
      # Key in the secret containing the password; optional, defaults to 'password'
      passwordKey: password
```

3. Each workload can request a username-password Secret to be created, by annotating the Pod with `credentials-operator.otterize.com/user-password-secret-name`. Below is an example of that annotation and passing the generated credentials into a container with environmental variables.

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: server
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: server
  template:
    metadata:
      annotations:
        # highlight-next-line
        credentials-operator.otterize.com/user-password-secret-name: server-creds
      labels:
        app: server
    spec:
      serviceAccountName: server
      containers:
        - name: server
          imagePullPolicy: Always
          image: 'supercool/my-example-container'
          ports:
            - containerPort: 80
          env:
            - name: DB_SERVER_USER
              valueFrom:
                secretKeyRef:
                  name: server-creds
                  key: username
            - name: DB_SERVER_PASSWORD
              valueFrom:
                secretKeyRef:
                  name: server-creds
                  key: password
```

4. Apply `ClientIntents` and the specified access will be `GRANT`ed to the workload in the `ClientIntents`.

```yaml
apiVersion: k8s.otterize.com/v2beta1
kind: ClientIntents
metadata:
  name: client-intents-for-server
  namespace: otterize-tutorial-postgres
spec:
  workload:
    name: server
    kind: Deployment
  targets:
    - sql:
        name: postgres-tutorial-db # Same name as our PostgreSQLServerConfig metadata.name
        privileges:
          - databaseName: otterize-tutorial
            table: public.example
            operations:
              - SELECT
              - INSERT
```

5. Done!
