# Overview
This tutorial will deploy an example cluster to highlight Otterize's PostgreSQL capabilities. Within that cluster is a client workload that hits an endpoint on a server, which then connects to a database. The server runs two different database operations:
1. An `INSERT` operation to append a table within the database
2. A `SELECT` operation to validate the updates.

The server needs appropriate permissions to access the database. You could use one admin user for all workloads, which is insecure and is the cause for many security breaches. With Otterize, you can specify required access, and have Otterize create users and perform correctly scoped SQL GRANTs just in time, as the workload spins up and down.

In this tutorial, we will:
* Deploy an example cluster
* Deploy Otterize in our cluster and give it access to our database instance
* Declare a ClientIntents resource for the server, specifying required access
* See that the required access has been granted

# Prerequisites

#### 1. Minikube Cluster
<details>
    <summary>Prepare a Kubernetes cluster with Minikube</summary>

For this tutorial you'll need a local Kubernetes cluster. Having a cluster with a [CNI](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/compute-storage-net/network-plugins/) that supports [NetworkPolicies](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/network-policies/) isn't required for this tutorial, but is recommended so that your cluster works with other tutorials.

If you don't have the Minikube CLI, first [install it](https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/start/).

Then start your Minikube cluster with Calico, in order to enforce network policies.

```shell
minikube start --cpus=4 --memory 4096 --disk-size 32g --cni=calico
```
</details>

#### 2. Deploy Otterize
To deploy Otterize, head over to [Otterize Cloud](https://app.otterize.com) and associate a Kubernetes cluster on the [Integrations page](https://app.otterize.com/integrations), and follow the instructions. If you already have a Kubernetes cluster connected, skip this step.


# Tutorial

### Deploy tutorial workloads and request database credentials
Next, set up the namespace used for our tutorial and deploy the client, server & database services in it:
``` shell
kubectl create namespace otterize-tutorial-postgres
kubectl apply -n otterize-tutorial-postgres -f ${ABSOLUTE_URL}/code-examples/postgres/client-server-database.yaml
```

<details>
<summary>Expand to see the deployment YAML</summary>

```yaml
{@include: ../../../../static/code-examples/postgres/client-server-database.yaml}
```
</details>


Our server's Deployment spec specifies an annotation on its Pod, which requests that the Otterize operator provision a username and password for it:
```yaml
  template:
    metadata:
      annotations:
        credentials-operator.otterize.com/user-password-secret-name: server-creds
```
This specifies that the secret `server-creds` will be populated with keys containing the username and password used by this pod to connect to the database.
The secret will only be created by the Otterize operator after it is integrated with your database by applying a `PostgreSQLServerConfig` resources.

### View logs for the server
After the client, server, and database are up and running, we can see that the server does not have the appropriate access to the database by inspecting the logs with the following command.

```shell
kubectl logs -f -n otterize-tutorial-postgres deploy/server
```

Example log:
<Terminal>
    Unable to perform INSERT operation
    <br></br>
    Unable to perform SELECT operation
</Terminal>



### Create an Otterize database integration and deploy a PostgreSQLServerConfig to allow Otterize DB access
To create a database integration, head over to the [Otterize Cloud](https://app.otterize.com) and navigate to the [Integrations page](https://app.otterize.com/integrations).
Click on the "Add Integration" button and select the "Database" option.
Fill in the required fields and click "Create" to create your integration.

Next, apply a `PostgreSQLServerConfig` so Otterize will know how to access our database instance:

- Create a Kuberentes secret containing the database credentials:
    ```shell
    kubectl create secret generic postgres-tutorial-db-credentials -n otterize-tutorial-postgres --from-literal=username='otterize-tutorial' --from-literal=password='jeffdog523'
    ```
    In this tutorial, the PostgreSQL database comes with the predefined username & password, but for future uses a
    role will have to be created in the database to grant Otterize access as well as the ability to configure other users.

- Apply the `PostgreSQLServerConfig` to the cluster:
    ```shell
    kubectl apply -n otterize-tutorial-postgres -f ${ABSOLUTE_URL}/code-examples/postgres/postgresqlserverconfig.yaml
    ```

This `PostgreSQLServerConfig` tells Otterize how to access a database instance named `postgres-tutorial-db`, meaning that when intents
are applied requesting access permissions to `postgres-tutorial-db`, the Otterize operator will be able to configure
them:

```yaml
{@include: ../../../../static/code-examples/postgres/postgresqlserverconfig.yaml}
```


### Define your ClientIntents

ClientIntents are Otterize’s way of defining access through unique relationships, which lead to perfectly scoped access. In this example, we provide our `server` workload the ability to insert and select records to allow it to access the database.

Below is our `intents.yaml` file. As you can see, it is scoped to our database named `otterize-tutorial` and our `public.example` table. We also have limited the access to just `SELECT` and `INSERT` operations. We could add more databases, tables, or operations if our workload required more access.

Specifying the table and operations is optional. If you don't specify the table, access will be granted to all tables in the specified database. If you don't specify the operations, all operations will be allowed.
```yaml
{@include: ../../../../static/code-examples/postgres/clientintents.yaml}
```

We can now apply our intents. Behind the scenes, the Otterize operator created the user for our `server` workload and executed `GRANT` queries on the database, making our `SELECT` and `INSERT` errors disappear.

```shell
kubectl apply -n otterize-tutorial-postgres -f ${ABSOLUTE_URL}/code-examples/postgres/clientintents.yaml
```

### View logs for the server
We can now view the server logs once again. This time, we should see that the server has the appropriate access to the database:

```shell
kubectl logs -f -n otterize-tutorial-postgres deploy/server
```

Example log:
<Terminal>
Successfully INSERTED into our table

Successfully SELECTED, most recent value:  2024-04-30T13:20:46Z
</Terminal>

That’s it! If your workload’s functionality changes, adding or removing access is as simple as updating your ClientIntents definitions. For fun, try altering the `operations` to just `SELECT` or `INSERT`.

# Teardown
To remove the deployed examples, run:
```shell
kubectl delete clientintents.k8s.otterize.com -n otterize-tutorial-postgres client-intents-for-server && \
kubectl delete namespace otterize-tutorial-postgres
```
