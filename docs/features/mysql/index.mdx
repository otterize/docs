# MySQL

Otterize is able to create just-in-time username-and-password pairs for your workload, providing them as a Kubernetes Secret that can be mounted to file or mapped to environment variables, as well as `GRANT`ing access to databases and tables, based on `ClientIntents` ([Intent-Based Access Control](/overview/intent-based-access-control)) declarations.

### Tutorials

To learn how to use the Intents Operator and Credentials Operator to enforce access using MySQL GRANTs, try one of these quickstart tutorials:

### How does Otterize work with MySQL?

The Otterize credentials operator will create a unique MySQL username-password combination for each workload's use, exposed via a Kubernetes Secret. The workload will use these credentials to connect to the database. `ClientIntents` will define the access required by that workload. As the intents are applied, The Otterize intents operator will keep the database's list of users and GRANTs up to date so that the workload is able to access it.

1. To get started, your cluster must have Otterize deployed.
2. You'll need to create a `MySQLServerConfig` in your cluster, providing a connection URL and admin-level credentials for Otterize to manage permissions in your database. Below is an example `MySQLServerConfig` resource.
```yaml
apiVersion: k8s.otterize.com/v2alpha1
kind: MySQLServerConfig
metadata:
  name: mysql-tutorial-db # database instance name - should match the target in ClientIntents
  namespace: otterize-tutorial-mysql
spec:
  address: <HOST:PORT> # Your MySQL servers address
  credentials:
    # Username Otterize will connect with & configure permissions as; optional, can be omitted if using a secretRef
    username: <USER>
    # Password for the above username; optional, can be omitted if using a secretRef
    password: <PASSWORD>
    # Secret containing the database credentials; optional, can be omitted if using the above username & password fields
    secretRef:
      # Name of the secret containing the database credentials; required
      name: mysql-credentials
      # Namespace where the secret is stored; optional, defaults to the namespace of the MySQLServerConfig
      namespace: otterize-tutorial-mysql
      # Key in the secret containing the username; optional, defaults to 'username'
      usernameKey: username
      # Key in the secret containing the password; optional, defaults to 'password'
      passwordKey: password
```

3. Each workload can request a username-password Secret to be created, by annotating the Pod with `credentials-operator.otterize.com/user-password-secret-name`. Below is an example of that annotation and passing the generated credentials into a container with environmental variables.

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: server
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: server
  template:
    metadata:
      annotations:
        # highlight-next-line
        credentials-operator.otterize.com/user-password-secret-name: server-creds
      labels:
        app: server
    spec:
      serviceAccountName: server
      containers:
        - name: server
          imagePullPolicy: Always
          image: 'supercool/my-example-container'
          ports:
            - containerPort: 80
          env:
            - name: DB_SERVER_USER
              valueFrom:
                secretKeyRef:
                  name: server-creds
                  key: username
            - name: DB_SERVER_PASSWORD
              valueFrom:
                secretKeyRef:
                  name: server-creds
                  key: password
```


4. Apply `ClientIntents` and the specified access will be `GRANT`ed to the workload in the `ClientIntents`.


```yaml
apiVersion: k8s.otterize.com/v2alpha1
kind: ClientIntents
metadata:
  name: client-intents-for-server
  namespace: otterize-tutorial-mysql
spec:
  workload:
    name: server
    kind: Deployment
  targets:
    - sql:
        name: mysql-tutorial-db # Same name as MySQLServerConfig metadata.name
        privileges:
          - databaseName: otterize-tutorial
            table: example
            operations:
              - SELECT
              - INSERT
```

5. Done!
