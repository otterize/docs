# Overview
This tutorial will deploy an example cluster to highlight Otterize's MySQL capabilities. Within that cluster is a client service that hits an endpoint on a server, which then connects to a database. The server runs two different database operations:
1. An `INSERT` operation to append a table within the database
2. A `SELECT` operation to validate the updates.

The server needs appropriate permissions to access the database. You could use one admin user for all services, which is insecure and is the cause for many security breaches. With Otterize, you can specify required access, and have Otterize create users and perform correctly scoped SQL GRANTs just in time, as the service spins up and down.

In this tutorial, we will:
* Optionally, spin up a MySQL database instance on AWS, based on Amazon RDS for MySQL, or in your Kubernetes cluster, based on the official MySQL Docker image. Alternatively, you could use any MySQL server of your choice.
* Deploy an example cluster
* Deploy Otterize in our cluster and give it access to our database instance
* Declare a ClientIntents resource for the server, specifying required access
* See that the required access has been granted

# Prerequisites

#### 1. Minikube Cluster
<details>
    <summary>Prepare a Kubernetes cluster with Minikube</summary>

For this tutorial you'll need a local Kubernetes cluster. Having a cluster with a [CNI](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/compute-storage-net/network-plugins/) that supports [NetworkPolicies](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/network-policies/) isn't required for this tutorial, but is recommended so that your cluster works with other tutorials.

If you don't have the Minikube CLI, first [install it](https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/start/).

Then start your Minikube cluster with Calico, in order to enforce network policies.

```shell
minikube start --cpus=4 --memory 4096 --disk-size 32g --cni=calico
```
</details>

#### 2. Deploy Otterize
To deploy Otterize, head over to [Otterize Cloud](https://app.otterize.com) and associate a Kubernetes cluster on the [Integrations page](https://app.otterize.com/integrations), and follow the instructions. If you already have a Kubernetes cluster connected, skip this step.

#### 3. Deploy a MySQL database instance
Already have a MySQL database instance? [Skip to the tutorial.](#tutorial)

<details>
<summary>Deploy a MySQL database instance, based on Amazon RDS for MySQL</summary>

Follow the [installation instructions on the AWS RDS documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/CHAP_GettingStarted.CreatingConnecting.MySQL.html#CHAP_GettingStarted.Creating.MySQL).

<li>
    You may use the Free tier template for this tutorial.
</li>
<li>
    Under "Settings", choose "Auto generate password". Make sure you save the generated password after the instance is created.
</li>
<li>
    Under "Connectivity", enable public access to allow access from your Kubernetes cluster. Otterize will require that access to manage credentials for you.
    Additionally, make sure you choose a security group that allows inbound access from the internet.
</li>

</details>

<details>
<summary>Deploy a MySQL database instance, based on the official MySQL Docker image</summary>

To deploy a local MySQL database instance, you can use the official MySQL Docker image. Run the following command to deploy a MySQL instance with the root password set to `password`:
```shell
kubectl create namespace otterize-tutorial-mysql
kubectl apply -n otterize-tutorial-mysql -f ${ABSOLUTE_URL}/code-examples/mysql/database.yaml
```

Next, start a MySQL client to connect to your MySQL instance:
```shell
POD=$(kubectl get pod -n otterize-tutorial-mysql -l app=mysql -o jsonpath="{.items[0].metadata.name}")
kubectl exec -it -n otterize-tutorial-mysql $POD -- mysql -uroot -ppassword
```

Run the following command to create an admin user, used for this tutorial:
```mysql
CREATE USER 'admin'@'%' IDENTIFIED BY 'password';
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON *.* TO 'admin'@'%' WITH GRANT OPTION;
FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
exit;
```

Use the following values as your MySQL host and password:

```shell
export MYSQLHOST=mysql.otterize-tutorial-mysql.svc.cluster.local
export MYSQLUSER=admin
export MYSQLPASSWORD=password
```
</details>

# Tutorial

### Setup MySQL database and table for the tutorial
Throughout this tutorial, we will refer to your MySQL host & credentials via environment variables, so make sure to set them up:
```shell
export MYSQLHOST=<YOURMYSQLHOST> # For RDS, this is the endpoint; for the official MySQL docker image, this is `mysql.otterize-tutorial-mysql.svc.cluster.local`
export MYSQLUSER=admin
export MYSQLPASSWORD=<YOURPASSWORD> # For RDS, this is the password set during the RDS instance deployment; for the official MySQL docker image, this is `password`
```

Next, start a MySQL client to connect to your MySQL instance:
```shell
kubectl create namespace otterize-tutorial-mysql
kubectl run -n otterize-tutorial-mysql -it --rm --image=mysql:latest --restart=Never mysql-client -- mysql -h $MYSQLHOST -u $MYSQLUSER -p$MYSQLPASSWORD
```

And run the following command to create a database named `otterize_tutorial` and a table named `example` in your MySQL instance.
Our tutorial server will use this database and table to perform `INSERT` and `SELECT` operations.
```mysql
CREATE DATABASE IF NOT EXISTS otterize_example;

USE otterize_example;

CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS example
(
    file_name   VARCHAR(255),
    upload_time BIGINT
);

exit;
```

### Deploy tutorial services and request database credentials
Next, set up the namespace used for our tutorial and deploy the client & server services in it:

```shell
kubectl create namespace otterize-tutorial-mysql
kubectl apply -n otterize-tutorial-mysql -f ${ABSOLUTE_URL}/code-examples/mysql/client-server.yaml
kubectl patch deployment -n otterize-tutorial-mysql server --type='json' -p="[{\"op\": \"replace\", \"path\": \"/spec/template/spec/containers/0/env/0/value\", \"value\": \"$MYSQLHOST\"}]"
```


<details>
<summary>Expand to see the deployment YAML</summary>

```yaml
{@include: ../../../../static/code-examples/mysql/client-server.yaml}
```
</details>

Our server's Deployment spec specify an annotation on its Pod, which requests that the Otterize operator provision a username and password for it:
```yaml
  template:
    metadata:
      annotations:
        credentials-operator.otterize.com/user-password-secret-name: server-creds
```
This specifies that the secret `server-creds` will be populated with keys containing the username and password used by this pod to connect to the database.
The secret will only be created by the Otterize operator after it is integrated with your database by applying a MySQLServerConfig resources.


### View logs for the server
After the client, server, and database are up and running, we can see that the server does not have the appropriate access to the database by inspecting the logs with the following command.

```shell
kubectl logs -f -n otterize-tutorial-mysql deploy/server
```

Example log:
<Terminal>
    Unable to perform INSERT operation
    <br></br>
    Unable to perform SELECT operation
</Terminal>


### Deploy a MySQLServerConfig to allow Otterize DB access
Let's apply a `MySQLServerConfig` so Otterize will know how to access our database instance:
```shell
kubectl apply -n otterize-tutorial-mysql -f ${ABSOLUTE_URL}/code-examples/mysql/mysqlserverconfig.yaml
kubectl patch mysqlserverconfig -n otterize-tutorial-mysql mysql-tutorial-db --type='json' -p="[{\"op\": \"replace\", \"path\": \"/spec/address\", \"value\": \"$MYSQLHOST\"}]"
MYSQLUSER_B64=$(echo -n $MYSQLUSER | base64)
MYSQLPASSWORD_B64=$(echo -n $MYSQLPASSWORD | base64)
kubectl patch secret -n otterize-tutorial-mysql mysql-tutorial-db-credentials --type='json' -p="[{\"op\": \"replace\", \"path\": \"/data/username\", \"value\": \"$MYSQLUSER_B64\"}, {\"op\": \"replace\", \"path\": \"/data/password\", \"value\": \"$MYSQLPASSWORD_B64\"}]"
```

This applies the following `MySQLServerConfig` to your cluster, and patches it with your DB instance address & credentials:


```yaml
{@include: ../../../../static/code-examples/mysql/mysqlserverconfig.yaml}
```

The above CRD tells Otterize how to access a database instance named `mysql-tutorial-db`, meaning that when intents
are applied requesting access permissions to `mysql-tutorial-db`, the Otterize operator will be able to configure
them.

In this tutorial, we use the admin user to grant Otterize permissions to create users and grant them access to the database.
In a production environment, it is recommended to create a dedicated user for Otterize, and grant it the necessary permissions to create and manage other users.


### Define your ClientIntents

ClientIntents are Otterize’s way of defining access through unique relationships, which lead to perfectly scoped access. In this example, we provide our `server` workload the ability to insert and select records to allow it to access the database.

Below is our `intents.yaml` file. As you can see, it is scoped to our database named `otterize_tutorial` and our `example` table. We also have limited the access to just `SELECT` and `INSERT` operations. We could add more databases, tables, or operations if our service required more access.

Specifying the table and operations is optional. If you don't specify the table, access will be granted to all tables in the specified database. If you don't specify the operations, all operations will be allowed.
```yaml
{@include: ../../../../static/code-examples/mysql/clientintents.yaml}
```
We can now apply our intents. Behind the scenes, the Otterize operator created the user for our `server` workload and executed `GRANT` queries on the database, making our `SELECT` and `INSERT` errors disappear.

```shell
kubectl apply -n otterize-tutorial-mysql -f ${ABSOLUTE_URL}/code-examples/mysql/clientintents.yaml
```

### View logs for the server
We can now view the server logs once again. This time, we should see that the server has the appropriate access to the database:

```shell
kubectl logs -f -n otterize-tutorial-mysql deploy/server
```

Example log:
<Terminal>
Successfully INSERTED into our table

Successfully SELECTED, most recent value:  2024-04-30T13:20:46Z
</Terminal>

That’s it! If your service’s functionality changes, adding or removing access is as simple as updating your ClientIntents definitions. For fun, try altering the `operations` to just `SELECT` or `INSERT`.

# Teardown
To remove the deployed examples, run:
```shell
kubectl delete clientintents.k8s.otterize.com -n otterize-tutorial-mysql client-intents-for-server
kubectl delete namespace otterize-tutorial-mysql
```
