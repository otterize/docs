With its Kafka watcher enabled, the network mapper allows you to map topic-level access to Kafka servers within your Kubernetes cluster.
This provides a clear picture of which Kafka topics are being accessed and with which operations.
In this tutorial, we will:

- Deploy a Kafka broker, and three clients that call it.
- Discover which topics are being accessed by those clients, and with which operations, using the Otterize network mapper's Kafka watcher.

We will **not** be doing any access control in this demo, just purely mapping client-to-Kafka access at the topic and operation level.

## Prerequisites

Already have Otterize & a Kafka broker deployed on your cluster? Skip to the [tutorial](#tutorial).

### 1. Deploy Otterize
To deploy Otterize, head over to [Otterize Cloud](https://app.otterize.com) and associate a Kubernetes cluster on the [Integrations page](https://app.otterize.com/integrations), and follow the instructions. If you already have a Kubernetes cluster connected, skip this step.

### 2. Install Kafka

We will deploy a Kafka broker using Bitnami's [Helm chart](https://github.com/bitnami/charts/tree/master/bitnami/kafka).
In the chart we will configure Kafka to:

- Recognize the Otterize intents operator as a super user so it can configure ACLs.
- Turn on Kafka debug logging to allow the Kafka watcher to feed topic-level client access information to the network mapper.

<details>
<summary>Expand to see the Helm values.yaml used with the Bitnami chart</summary>

```yaml
{@include: ../../../../static/code-examples/kafka-mapping/helm/values.yaml}
```

</details>

The following command will deploy a Kafka broker with this chart:

```bash
helm repo add bitnami https://charts.bitnami.com/bitnami
helm repo update
helm install --create-namespace -n kafka \
  -f ${ABSOLUTE_URL}/code-examples/kafka-mapping/helm/values.yaml kafka bitnami/kafka --version 21.4.4
```

## Tutorial

### Deploy demo to simulate traffic

Let's add a few workloads that will access our Kafka server, and see how the network mapper builds the access map:

- One workload named "**client**".
- One workload named "**client-2**".

To deploy these workloads, use:

```shell
kubectl apply -n otterize-tutorial-kafka-mapping -f ${ABSOLUTE_URL}/code-examples/kafka-mapping/all.yaml
```

Each of these workloads is built to periodically call the Kafka broker we deployed. Because that broker has the Otterize OSS Kafka watcher enabled and feeding data to the network mapper, we can query the network mapper directly to see the map it has built up.

```shell
otterize network-mapper list -n otterize-tutorial-kafka-mapping
```

We expect to see:

- `client` consuming from `mytopic`.
- `client-2` producing to `mytopic`.

And indeed:

```shell
client in namespace otterize-tutorial-kafka-mapping calls:
  - kafka in namespace kafka
    - Kafka topic: transactions, operations: [describe]
    - Kafka topic: mytopic, operations: [describe consume]
client-2 in namespace otterize-tutorial-kafka-mapping calls:
  - kafka in namespace kafka
    - Kafka topic: transactions, operations: [describe]
    - Kafka topic: mytopic, operations: [produce describe]
```

If you've attached Otterize OSS to Otterize Cloud, go back to see the [access graph in your browser](https://app.otterize.com).
**To only see Kafka information**, make sure to de-select the 'Use in access graph' settings for network policies and Istio policies, and leave Kafka ACLs selected, like so:
![Access graph settings](/img/quick-tutorials/kafka-mapping/settings.png)

![Access graph](/img/quick-tutorials/kafka-mapping/discovered.png)
Only the arrows between the clients and the Kafka are green, because we've selected Kafka ACLs for access graph. The other arrows were detected through network mapping, but since there's no Kafka mapping for those arrows, they are grayed out.

Clicking on a specific arrow between a client and the broker reveals which topic and operations are being accessed.

### What did we accomplish?

Enabling the Kafka watcher component of the network mapper shows which clients connect to running Kafka servers, the topics they access, and the operations they undertake on those topics.

You can consume this information in various ways:

- Visually via the access graph, where shadow mode shows you what would in enforcement mode before actually turning on enforcement, and auto-generating client intents to bootstrap rolling out IBAC.
- [Via the CLI](/reference/cli): from the network mapper directly or the cloud.
- [Via the API](https://app.otterize.com/api/rest/v1beta).

## Teardown

To remove the deployed examples run:

```bash
helm uninstall otterize -n otterize-system
helm uninstall kafka -n kafka
helm delete ns otterize-tutorial-kafka-mapping
