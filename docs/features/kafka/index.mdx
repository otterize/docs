# Kafka

Otterize can build a map of your cluster, and enforce access between services using Kafka ACLs. Otterize is also able to map access to the Kafka topic and operation level, by reading Kafka access logs.

### Tutorials

To learn how to use the Intents Operator and Credentials Operator to enforce access with Kafka ACLs, or how to map your cluster to the Kafka topic and operation level, try one of these quickstart tutorials.

### How does Otterize work with Kafka?

1. First, the cluster must have [Otterize installed](/overview/installation).
2. Configure the Otterize Intents Operator to manage a Kafka broker by declaring a `KafkaServerConfig`. See the example yaml below.

```yaml
apiVersion: k8s.otterize.com/v1alpha3
kind: KafkaServerConfig
metadata:
  name: kafkaserverconfig
  namespace: kafka
spec:
  service:
    name: kafka #name of the Kafka service broker
  addr: kafka.kafka:9092
```

Or, as a ready-to-paste command:
```bash
kubectl apply -f ${ABSOLUTE_URL}/code-examples/kafka-mtls/kafkaserverconfig.yaml
```

The Kafka broker must be configured with a superuser for the Intents Operator to be able to set ACLs, with the ACL authorizer enabled, and to use mTLS, which the Intents Operator and other clients will use to authenticate.
Here's an example configuration based on the `values.yaml` of the Bitnami Kafka Helm chart. To see a working example, check out the tutorials for Kafka.

```yaml
superUsers: User:CN=intents-operator.otterize-system
allowEveryoneIfNoAclFound: true
podAnnotations:
  credentials-operator.otterize.com/cert-type: jks
  credentials-operator.otterize.com/tls-secret-name: kafka-tls-secret
  credentials-operator.otterize.com/dns-names: "kafka-0.kafka-headless.kafka.svc.cluster.local,kafka.kafka.svc.cluster.local"
# Authenticate clients using mTLS
auth:
  clientProtocol: mtls
  interBrokerProtocol: mtls
  tls:
    type: jks
    existingSecrets:
      - kafka-tls-secret
    password: password
    jksTruststore: truststore.jks
    jksKeystoreSAN: keystore.jks
authorizerClassName: kafka.security.authorizer.AclAuthorizer
```

To acquire TLS credentials for another pod, specify a Pod annotation with the required TLS secret name.
```yaml
spec:
  template:
    metadata:
      annotations:
        # 1. Generate credentials as a secret called "client-credentials-secret":
        credentials-operator.otterize.com/tls-secret-name: client-credentials-secret
        ...
    spec:
      volumes:
        # 2. Create a volume containing this secret:
        - name: otterize-credentials
          secret:
            secretName: client-credentials-secret
        ...
      containers:
        - name: client
          ...
          volumeMounts:
            # 3. Mount volume into container
            - name: otterize-credentials
              mountPath: /var/otterize/credentials
              readOnly: true
```

4. Once the Kafka clients are deployed with the mTLS credentials, they should be able to access topics as we have enabled `allowEveryoneIfNoAclFound`. To begin enforcing, declare ClientIntents, which will cause the Intents Operator to configure ACLs allowing this access.

```yaml
apiVersion: k8s.otterize.com/v1alpha3
kind: ClientIntents
metadata:
  name: client
  namespace: otterize-tutorial-kafka-mtls
spec:
  service:
    name: client
  calls:
    - name: kafka.kafka
      type: kafka
      kafkaTopics:
        - name: mytopic
          operations: [ produce,describe,consume ]
        - name: transactions
          operations: [ produce,describe,consume ]
```
