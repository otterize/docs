### How does Otterize work with Linkerd?

1. First, the cluster must have [Otterize installed](/overview/installation).
2. To have Otterize generate Linkerd authorization policies, declare and apply ([IBAC](/overview/intent-based-access-control)) ClientIntents for your services.
Once you do so, Otterize will generate a Linkerd authorization policy allowing access from the client service, identified by its service account, to the server, identified by a Linkerd Server resource.
The HTTP Resources section in the ClientIntents is optional: if you do not specify it, all pod-to-pod access is allowed.

```yaml

apiVersion: k8s.otterize.com/v1alpha3
kind: ClientIntents
metadata:
  name: client
  namespace: otterize-tutorial-linkerd
spec:
  service:
    name: client
  calls:
    - name: server-abc
      type: http
      HTTPResources:
        - path: /client-path
          methods: [ GET ]

```
