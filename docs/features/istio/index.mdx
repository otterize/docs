# Istio

Otterize can build a map of your cluster based on Istio Envoy metrics, and enforce access between workloads using Istio Authorization Policies.

### Tutorials

To learn how to use the Intents Operator to enforce access using Istio authorization policies, or map your cluster, try one of these quickstart tutorials.

### How does Otterize work with Istio?

1. First, the cluster must have [Otterize installed](/overview/installation).
2. To have Otterize generate Istio authorization policies, declare and apply ([IBAC](/overview/intent-based-access-control)) ClientIntents for your workloads.
Once you do so, Otterize will generate an Istio authorization policy allowing access from the client workload, identified by its ServiceAccount, to the server, identified by its labels.
The HTTP Resources section in the ClientIntents is optional: if you do not specify it, all pod-to-pod access is allowed.

```yaml

apiVersion: k8s.otterize.com/v2alpha1
kind: ClientIntents
metadata:
  name: client
  namespace: otterize-tutorial-istio
spec:
  workload:
    name: client
    kind: Deployment
  targets:
    - service:
        name: server-abc
        http:
          - path: /client-path
            methods: [ GET ]

```

3. If you would like Otterize to be able to autogenerate ClientIntents and map your network at the HTTP path and method level, we need to enable connection telemetry data within Istio. This can be enabled with the following YAML:

```yaml
apiVersion: telemetry.istio.io/v1alpha1
kind: Telemetry
metadata:
  name: mesh-default
  namespace: istio-system
spec:
  # Configure access logging for Istio services
  accessLogging:
    # Define the access logging provider, in this case, Envoy
    - providers:
        - name: envoy
  metrics:
    # Configure metrics collection for Istio services using Prometheus
    - providers:
        - name: prometheus
      # Customize metric tag overrides
      overrides:
        - tagOverrides:
            # Map the "request_method" metric tag to "request.method" value
            request_method:
              value: request.method
            # Map the "request_path" metric tag to "request.path" value
            request_path:
              value: request.path
```

Or, as a ready-to-paste command:
```
kubectl apply -f ${ABSOLUTE_URL}/code-examples/network-mapper/istio-telemetry-enablement.yaml -n istio-system
```

Once installed, Otterize will query Envoy sidecars for known connections and build an in-memory map of the relationships. After the map is built you can then view those relationships.
