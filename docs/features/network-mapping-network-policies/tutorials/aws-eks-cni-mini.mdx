This tutorial will walk you through deploying an AWS EKS cluster with the AWS VPC CNI add-on, while enabling the new network policy support on EKS with Otterize.

## Prerequisites

- An EKS cluster with the AWS VPC CNI add-on installed and with the new built-in network policy support enabled. See [Installing the AWS VPC CNI add-on](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/pod-networking.html) for more information, or follow the instructions below.
- The [Otterize CLI](/overview/installation#install-the-otterize-cli).
- The [AWS CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-install.html).
- The [kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl/) command-line tool.

## Tutorial

### Step one: Create an AWS EKS cluster with the AWS VPC CNI plugin

Before you start, you'll need an AWS Kubernetes cluster. Having a cluster with a [CNI](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/compute-storage-net/network-plugins/) that supports [NetworkPolicies](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/network-policies/) is required for this tutorial.

```shell
eksctl create cluster -f cluster-config.yaml
```

Run the following command to create your AWS cluster. [Don't have eksctl? Install it now.](https://eksctl.io/installation/)

```bash
curl ${ABSOLUTE_URL}/code-examples/aws-eks-mini/cluster-config.yaml | eksctl create cluster -f -
```
<details>
<summary>Inspect eks-cluster.yaml contents</summary>

```yaml
{@include: ../../../../static/code-examples/aws-eks-mini/cluster-config.yaml}
```
</details>

Once your AWS EKS has finished deploying the control pane and node group, the next step is deploying Otterize as well as a couple of clients and a server to see how they are affected by network policies.

### Step two: Install the Otterize agents

### Install Otterize on your cluster

To deploy Otterize, head over to [Otterize Cloud](https://app.otterize.com) and create a Kubernetes cluster on the [Integrations page](https://app.otterize.com/integrations), and follow the instructions.

### Deploy a server and two clients

So that we have some pods to look at (and protect), you can install our simple clients and server demo app that will deploy a server and 2 clients.

```bash
kubectl apply -f ${ABSOLUTE_URL}/code-examples/automate-network-policies/all.yaml
```

Once you have that installed and running your Otterize access graph should look something like this:

![Access Graph](/img/quick-tutorials/aws-eks-mini/access-graph.png)

### Step three: Create an intent

Now that you have Otterize installed, the next step is to create an intent which will enable access to the server from the client. If you enable protection on the server without declaring an intent, the client will be blocked.

:::tip

You can click on the workloads or the lines connecting them to see which ClientIntents you need to apply to make the connection go green!

:::

```shell
otterize network-mapper export --server server.otterize-tutorial-eks | kubectl apply -f -
```

Running this command will generate the following `ClientIntents` for each client connected to `server` and apply it to your cluster. You could also place it in a Helm chart or apply it some other way, instead of piping it directly to kubectl.

```yaml
apiVersion: k8s.otterize.com/v2beta1
kind: ClientIntents
metadata:
  name: client
  namespace: otterize-tutorial-eks
spec:
  workload:
    name: client
    kind: Deployment
  targets:
    - service:
        name: server
---
apiVersion: k8s.otterize.com/v2beta1
kind: ClientIntents
metadata:
  name: client-other
  namespace: otterize-tutorial-eks
spec:
  workload:
    name: client-other
    kind: Deployment
  targets:
    - service:
        name: server
```

At which point you should see that the `server` workload is ready to be protected:

![One intent applied](/img/quick-tutorials/aws-eks-mini/one-intent.png)

And you can then protect the `server` workload by applying the following `yaml` file:

```yaml
{@include: ../../../../static/code-examples/aws-eks-mini/protect-server.yaml}
```

Protect the server by applying the resource:

```bash
kubectl apply -f ${ABSOLUTE_URL}/code-examples/aws-eks-mini/protect-server.yaml
```
And you should see your access graph showing the workload as protected:

![Protected Service](/img/quick-tutorials/aws-eks-mini/protected.png)

### What's next

Have a look at the [guide on how to deploy protection to a larger, more complex application one step at a time](/features/network-mapping-network-policies/tutorials/protect-1-service-network-policies).

## Teardown

To remove the deployed examples run:

```bash
kubectl delete -f protect-server.yaml
otterize network-mapper export --server server.otterize-tutorial-eks | kubectl delete -f -
kubectl delete -f ${ABSOLUTE_URL}/code-examples/automate-network-policies/all.yaml
helm uninstall otterize -n otterize-system
eksctl delete cluster -f cluster-config.yaml
```
