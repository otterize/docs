### About

Otterize empowers you to comprehend, visualize, and oversee access across Kubernetes networks. Once installed, it analyzes network traffic to construct an in-memory map detailing the connections. This map can be explored or exported through multiple formats, offering insights into your network's interconnectivity. Leveraging Intent-Based Access Control (IBAC) policies, Otterize acts as a sophisticated control plane for Kubernetes networks. It enables the automatic generation of declarative, intent-based access policies, facilitating the establishment of minimal privilege access between pods with ease.

### Mapping & visualizing

Following installation, Otterize begins to gather network traffic data, assembling it into a comprehensive graph that illustrates the connections between pod-to-pod and pod-to-public internet traffic. This graph serves as a dynamic blueprint of network interactions, which can be exported or visualized through multiple methods. Users of Otterize Cloud have the advantage of directly interacting with these graph structures within the Otterize application interface, offering an intuitive and interactive experience. For open-source software (OSS) users, Otterize provides a command-line interface (CLI) tool. This tool enables users to export the network data into JSON format, list the relationships captured in the graph, or even generate Intent-Based Access Control (IBAC) policies that mirror the observed traffic patterns, facilitating a tailored and secure network environment.

### Access control

By default, Kubernetes pods permit all outgoing and incoming traffic, posing potential security risks. Kubernetes [NetworkPolicies](/reference/terminology#network-policies) offer `policyTypes` that can be employed to limit either egress or ingress traffic, thereby enhancing security and compliance. Leveraging its in-memory traffic map, Otterize is capable of automatically crafting Intent-Based Access Control (IBAC) policies that accurately represent the existing traffic patterns within a cluster. Upon the submission of these IBAC policies, Otterize proceeds to create and implement the appropriate NetworkPolicies for your namespaces, ensuring a secure network configuration that aligns with your traffic's actual flow.
