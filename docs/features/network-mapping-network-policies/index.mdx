Otterize's open-source [Network Mapper](/reference/network-mapper) and [Intents Operator](/reference/intents-operator) can map your cluster, with zero configuration, low privileges and low resource usage, and automate the management of network policies.

### Tutorials

### Mapping & visualizing

Otterize's [Network Mapper](/reference/network-mapper) is a zero-config, open-source and non-invasive tool to map your cluster. Deploy it on your cluster to get a graphical, textual or JSON representation of your cluster, and optionally use it to generate ClientIntents, which are declarations of the access each service in your cluster requires.

By connecting your cluster to Otterize Cloud, you'll immediately be presented with an interactive, historic and filterable map of your cluster.
You can access the same information in different formats by using the open-source Otterize CLI, with the commands `otterize mapper export`, `otterize mapper list` and `otterize mapper visualize`.

**otterize mapper visualize example:**
![visualize example](/img/examples/example-visualize.png)

**otterize mapper list example:**
```
client in namespace otterize-tutorial-npol calls:
  - server in namespace otterize-tutorial-npol
client-other in namespace otterize-tutorial-npol calls:
  - server in namespace otterize-tutorial-npol
```
**otterize mapper export example:**
```yaml
apiVersion: k8s.otterize.com/v2alpha1
kind: ClientIntents
metadata:
  name: client
  namespace: otterize-tutorial-npol
spec:
  workload:
    name: client
    kind: Deployment
  targets:
    - service:
        name: server
---
apiVersion: k8s.otterize.com/v2alpha1
kind: ClientIntents
metadata:
  name: client-other
  namespace: otterize-tutorial-npol
spec:
  workload:
    name: client-other
    kind: Deployment
  targets:
    - service:
        name: server
```


### Access control

By default, Kubernetes pods permit all outgoing and incoming traffic, posing potential security risks.

Kubernetes [NetworkPolicies](/reference/terminology#network-policies) can be employed to limit either egress or ingress traffic, thereby enhancing security and compliance.
Having deployed Otterize, you can then apply the [ClientIntents](/reference/ClientIntents%20CRD) generated by the network mapper, or declared by you, to your cluster. The [Intents Operator](/reference/intents-operator) calculates which [Network Policies](/reference/terminology#network-policies) are required to allow the traffic declared by the ClientIntents, enforcing access on your cluster so that only intentional access is allowed.

Read more in the [Network Policies Deep Dive](/features/network-mapping-network-policies/Reference/Network-Policies-Deep-Dive).

```yaml
apiVersion: k8s.otterize.com/v2alpha1
kind: ClientIntents
metadata:
  name: client
  namespace: otterize-tutorial-istio
spec:
  workload:
    name: client
  targets:
    - service:
        name: nginx
```
