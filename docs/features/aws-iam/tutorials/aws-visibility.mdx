Many production Kubernetes workloads depend on cloud resources, such as S3 buckets, RDS databases, and Lambda functions. In this tutorial, you will learn how Otterize can enhance your visibility into the AWS resources that are accessed by your workloads.

In this tutorial, you will:

* Set up an EKS cluster.
* Deploy two Lambda functions.
* Deploy a *server* pod that retrieves a joke (as a string) from one Lambda function, reviews it, and posts the review to another Lambda function.
* Automatically detect and monitor the Lambda function calls using Otterize.

By the end of this tutorial, you will understand how to map Kubernetes workloads and their associated AWS resources using Otterize.

## Prerequisites

### CLI tools
You will need the following CLI tools to work with this environment:

1. [AWS CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/getting-started-install.html) - Ensure you have credentials within the target account that grant permissions to work with EKS clusters, IAM, CloudFormation, and Lambda functions.
2. [eksctl](https://eksctl.io/installation/) - This tool simplifies the creation and management of an EKS cluster.

### Create an EKS cluster
Already have EKS cluster? Skip to the [next step](#enable-aws-visibility-with-otterize-installation).

Start by creating an EKS cluster for deploying your pods. Use the **eksctl** tool with the following YAML configuration:
```bash
curl ${ABSOLUTE_URL}/code-examples/aws-visibility/eks-cluster.yaml | eksctl create cluster -f -
```
<details>
    <summary>Inspect eks-cluster.yaml contents</summary>

```yaml
{@include: ../../../../static/code-examples/aws-visibility/eks-cluster.yaml}
```
</details>

Next, update your **kubeconfig** to connect with the new cluster.
```bash
aws eks update-kubeconfig --name otterize-tutorial-aws-visibility --region 'us-west-2'
```

### Enable AWS Visibility
You will first need to install Otterize in your cluster. If your cluster is not already connected, you can do so by following the Kubernetes setup instructions detailed on the [Integrations](https://app.otterize.com/integrations) page.

:::info Important
When installing Otterize, append the following flag to the helm command to enable aws visibility:
:::

```bash
--set networkMapper.aws.visibility.enabled=true
```

## Tutorial

Now that your environment is set up, you are ready to deploy the application components, including the AWS resources that Otterize will monitor.

### Deploy two Lambda functions

First, you will deploy two Lambda functions: `DadJokeLambdaFunction` and `FeedbackLambdaFunction`. These functions will interact with your *server* pod to generate a dad joke training dataset. The *server* pod receives a joke from the ``DadJokeLambdaFunction``, reviews the joke, and sends the feedback to the `FeedbackLambdaFunction`.

To deploy the Lambda functions and their required roles, use the following command:

```bash
curl ${ABSOLUTE_URL}/code-examples/aws-visibility/cloudformation.yaml -o template.yaml && \
aws cloudformation deploy --template-file template.yaml --stack-name OtterizeTutorialJokeTrainingStack --capabilities CAPABILITY_IAM --region 'us-west-2'
```
<details>
    <summary>Inspect CloudFormation YAML</summary>

```yaml
{@include: ../../../../static/code-examples/aws-visibility/cloudformation.yaml}
```
</details>

### Deploy server with access to Lambda functions

With the Lambda functions deployed, you're now ready to deploy your *server* pod and configure it to interact with the two Lambda functions. Follow these steps to set up your environment:

- Create a namespace:

```bash
kubectl create namespace otterize-tutorial-aws-visibility
```

- Retrieve Lambda ARNs:

```bash
DAD_JOKE_LAMBDA_ARN=$(aws cloudformation describe-stacks --region 'us-west-2' --stack-name OtterizeTutorialJokeTrainingStack --query "Stacks[0].Outputs[?OutputKey=='DadJokeLambdaFunction'].OutputValue" --output text)
FEEDBACK_LAMBDA_ARN=$(aws cloudformation describe-stacks --region 'us-west-2' --stack-name OtterizeTutorialJokeTrainingStack --query "Stacks[0].Outputs[?OutputKey=='FeedbackLambdaFunction'].OutputValue" --output text)
```

- Create a `ConfigMap` for Lambda ARNs:

```bash
kubectl create configmap lambda-arns \
  --from-literal=dadJokeLambdaArn=$DAD_JOKE_LAMBDA_ARN \
  --from-literal=feedbackLambdaArn=$FEEDBACK_LAMBDA_ARN \
  -n otterize-tutorial-aws-visibility
```

- Generate AWS credentials and create a `Secret`:
```bash
USER_NAME=$(aws cloudformation describe-stacks --region 'us-west-2' --stack-name OtterizeTutorialJokeTrainingStack --query "Stacks[0].Outputs[?OutputKey=='LambdaInvokeUserAccessKeyId'].OutputValue" --output text)

aws iam create-access-key --user-name "$USER_NAME" | \
jq -r '"--from-literal=AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID="+.AccessKey.AccessKeyId+" --from-literal=AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY="+.AccessKey.SecretAccessKey' | \
xargs kubectl create secret generic aws-credentials -n otterize-tutorial-aws-visibility
```
- Deploy the *server* pod:

```bash 
kubectl apply -n otterize-tutorial-aws-visibility -f ${ABSOLUTE_URL}/code-examples/aws-visibility/all.yaml
```

<details>
    <summary>Inspect deployment YAML</summary>

```yaml
{@include: ../../../../static/code-examples/aws-visibility/all.yaml}
```
</details>

In the Kubernetes `Deployment` manifest, you will notice the following label in the pod template: `network-mapper.otterize.com/aws-visibility`. This label instructs the network mapper to track AWS API calls for this pod, helping identify the resources and actions being utilized.

Once the pod is deployed, you can verify the logs to confirm it is successfully calling the Lambda functions:

```bash
kubectl logs -f -n otterize-tutorial-aws-visibility deploy/joketrainer
```

Example output:
```
Joke: People saying 'boo! to their friends has risen by 85% in the last year.... That's a frightening statistic.
Sending Feedback of Funny?: Yes
Joke: Have you ever heard of a music group called Cellophane? They mostly wrap.
Sending Feedback of Funny?: Yes
Joke: What did Yoda say when he saw himself in 4K? "HDMI"
Sending Feedback of Funny?: No

```

### Visualize Relationships

With Otterize monitoring the AWS API calls, access Otterize Cloud to observe both Lambdas in action. The [Access graph](https://app.otterize.com/access-graph) will display two AWS resources associated with the *joketrainer* pod: *DadJokeLambdaFunction* and *FeedbackLambdaFunction*.

### What's Next

Now that you have learned how to enable visibility for AWS resources in your Kubernetes cluster, you are ready to explore how to manage access to these resources. Continue your learning journey with the next tutorial: [Automate AWS IAM for EKS](/features/aws-iam/tutorials/aws-iam-eks).

## Cleanup

To remove the deployed example:
```bash
kubectl delete namespace otterize-tutorial-aws-visibility
```

To remove the Lambda functions:
```bash
aws cloudformation delete-stack --stack-name OtterizeTutorialJokeTrainingStack --region 'us-west-2'
```

To remove the EKS cluster:
```bash
eksctl delete cluster --name otterize-tutorial-aws-visibility --region us-west-2
```
