Otterize automates AWS IAM roles and policies for your AWS EKS workloads, all in Kubernetes.

In this tutorial, we will:

- Optionally, spin up an EKS cluster.
- Deploy a server pod that uploads files to S3, and a client pod that submits files to the server app.
- Label the server pod, telling the credentials operator to link its Kubernetes ServiceAccount with an AWS IAM role created for it, such that AWS IRSA can recognize the pod.
- Create a `ClientIntents` resource allowing the server pod to upload to S3, that tells the intents operator to update the previously-created role's policy.
- See that the files have been uploaded successfully.

## Prerequisites
Already have Otterize deployed with the IAM integration configured on your cluster? [Skip to the tutorial.](#tutorial)

### 1. Create an AWS EKS cluster
Before you start, you'll need an AWS EKS cluster. Any cluster will do; there are no special requirements or setup.

<details>
<summary>How to set up an AWS EKS cluster using eksctl</summary>


Run the following command to create your AWS cluster. [Don't have eksctl? Install it now.](https://eksctl.io/installation/)

```bash
curl ${ABSOLUTE_URL}/code-examples/aws-iam-eks/cluster-config.yaml | eksctl create cluster -f -
```
<details>
    <summary>Inspect eks-cluster.yaml contents</summary>

    ```yaml
    {@include: ../../../../static/code-examples/aws-iam-eks/cluster-config}
    ```
</details>

</details>

Don't forget to configure your kubeconfig for your cluster. If using the example cluster above, use this command:
```bash
aws eks update-kubeconfig --region us-west-2 --name otterize-iam-eks-tutorial
```

### 2. Deploy Otterize for AWS IAM
To deploy Otterize, head over to [Otterize Cloud](https://app.otterize.com) and:

1. Create a Kubernetes cluster on the [Integrations page](https://app.otterize.com/integrations), and follow the instructions. *Make sure to enable enforcement mode for this tutorial.* If you already have a Kubernetes cluster connected, skip this step.

2. Create an AWS IAM integration on the [Integrations page](https://app.otterize.com/integrations).

If you are using the cluster from the previous step, the cluster name is `otterize-iam-eks-tutorial` and the region is `us-west-2`.

Once the AWS integration is configured, you'll be presented with a dialog to launch a CloudFormation template to configure the IAM roles for the Otterize operators.
This enables the operators to manage IAM for the pods in your cluster, and configures AWS IRSA on your cluster, if it is not yet configured.
This setup is required once per-cluster. [This template can be found on GitHub as well](https://github.com/otterize/setup/blob/main/aws-iam-operator-setup-template.yaml).

After CloudFormation has configured your cluster, click Next and you'll be presented with the configuration for deploying Otterize. Since you now have the AWS integration enabled, you need to redeploy Otterize with the credentials operator enabled, and with configuration telling the operators which AWS roles they will AssumeRole to in order to operate.

<details>
<summary>See how to manually configure AWS IRSA on your cluster for Otterize</summary>


You may also manually configure your cluster.
1. [Configure AWS IRSA on your cluster according to the official instructions from AWS.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/emr/latest/EMR-on-EKS-DevelopmentGuide/setting-up-enable-IAM.html)
2. Create IAM roles for the intents operator and credentials operator.

    1. Create two roles, named '[your-cluster-name]-otterize-intents-operator' and '[your-cluster-name]-otterize-credentials-operator'.
    2. Each of them should have a trust relationship with the intents-operator and credentials-operator service accounts on your cluster, and federated with your OpenIDConnect provider for the cluster.
    Here's an example:
    ```json
    {
        "Version": "2012-10-17",
        "Statement": [
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Principal": {
                "Federated": "arn:aws:iam::353146681200:oidc-provider/oidc.eks.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/id/C90DC306FCDDFFD362B58B0D28D844CB"
            },
            "Action": "sts:AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity",
            "Condition": {
                "StringEquals": {
                    "oidc.eks.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/id/C90DC306FCDDFFD362B58B0D28D844CB:sub": "system:serviceaccount:otterize-system:intents-operator-controller-manager"
                }
            }
        }
        ]
    }
    ```

In this example, `C90DC306FCDDFFD362B58B0D28D844CB` is your OpenIDConnect provider ID.
For the `credentials-operator`, substitute `system:serviceaccount:otterize-system:intents-operator-controller-manager` with `system:serviceaccount:otterize-system:credentials-operator-controller-manager`.


3. Create IAM policies for these two roles.
They should grant access to all `iam` permissions in the account, and a subset of `organizations` and `ec2` and `eks` permissions. Here's an example:
```yaml
    Statement:
        - Effect: Allow
    Action:
        - "iam:*"
        - "organizations:DescribeAccount"
        - "organizations:DescribeOrganization"
        - "organizations:DescribeOrganizationalUnit"
        - "organizations:DescribePolicy"
        - "organizations:ListChildren"
        - "organizations:ListParents"
        - "organizations:ListPoliciesForTarget"
        - "organizations:ListRoots"
        - "organizations:ListPolicies"
        - "organizations:ListTargetsForPolicy"
        - "ec2:DescribeInstances"
        - "eks:DescribeCluster"
    Resource: "*"
```

## Tutorial

### Create an S3 bucket for the server to use

First, we need to pick an S3 bucket name. Because S3 buckets are globally unique, we will save the bucket name in an environment variable for use later.

```bash
export BUCKET_NAME=otterize-tutorial-bucket-`date +%s`
echo $BUCKET_NAME
```

```bash
aws s3api create-bucket --bucket $BUCKET_NAME --region us-west-2 --create-bucket-configuration LocationConstraint=us-west-2
```

### Deploy the sample server and client

```shell
kubectl create namespace otterize-tutorial-iam
kubectl apply -n otterize-tutorial-iam -f ${ABSOLUTE_URL}/code-examples/aws-iam-eks/client-and-server.yaml
kubectl patch deployment -n otterize-tutorial-iam server --type='json' -p="[{\"op\": \"replace\", \"path\": \"/spec/template/spec/containers/0/env\", \"value\": [{\"name\": \"BUCKET_NAME\", \"value\": \"$BUCKET_NAME\"}]}]"
```

<details>
<summary>Expand to see the deployment YAML</summary>

```yaml
{@include: ../../../../static/code-examples/aws-iam-eks/client-and-server.yaml}
```

</details>

### View logs for the server - access denied
The server logs will show that it fails to upload files to the S3 bucket.

```bash
kubectl logs -f -n otterize-tutorial-iam deploy/server
```

```bash
2023/11/17 19:08:30 Couldn't upload file testfile.0.txt to otterize-tutorial-bucket-1700247949:testfile.0.txt.
Here's why: operation error S3: PutObject, https response error StatusCode: 403, RequestID: W9ZBNWPDFEMTBBS5, HostID: gsOlyxAmcUqFiYKzB7IwBoPia/Z2TDHEoaJjXT/qAxdduD4H17XDoGu21Pb7zeMms/YeThv2mJk=,
# highlight-next-line
api error AccessDenied: Access Denied
```

### Label the server pod to create an AWS IAM role
Label the server `Pod` so that the Otterize credentials operator creates an AWS IAM role for it and binds its Kubernetes ServiceAccount to the newly created role.
```yaml
metadata:
  labels:
    credentials-operator.otterize.com/create-aws-role: "true"
```

To do this, we won't be labeling the `Pod` directly, but instead patching the `template` attribute of the `Deployment` we created earlier so that it updates the `Pod`.

```bash
kubectl patch deployment -n otterize-tutorial-iam server -p '{"spec": {"template":{"metadata":{"labels":{"credentials-operator.otterize.com/create-aws-role":"true"}}}} }'
```

#### An AWS IAM role was created
Let's inspect the created role:
```bash
aws iam list-roles --query 'Roles[?starts_with(RoleName, `otr-`) == `true`]'
```

In the output, you should see that a role was created, with an `AssumeRolePolicyDocument` that enables the server's ServiceAccount to AssumeRole.
```json
    {
        "Path": "/",
        "RoleName": "otr-otterize-tutorial-iam.server@otterize-iam-eks-tutoria-ef91a7",
        "RoleId": "AROAVEOJOW5YM2CXSB4FJ",
        "Arn": "arn:aws:iam::353146681200:role/otr-otterize-tutorial-iam.server@otterize-iam-eks-tutoria-ef91a7",
        "CreateDate": "2023-11-21T12:03:42+00:00",
        "AssumeRolePolicyDocument": {
            "Version": "2012-10-17",
            "Statement": [
                {
                    "Effect": "Allow",
                    "Principal": {
                        "Federated": "arn:aws:iam::353146681200:oidc-provider/oidc.eks.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/id/84E95D704D69DB40F4E4B6B6A6777CA3"
                    },
                    "Action": "sts:AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity",
                    "Condition": {
                        "StringEquals": {
                            # highlight-next-line
                            "oidc.eks.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/id/84E95D704D69DB40F4E4B6B6A6777CA3:aud": "sts.amazonaws.com",
                            # highlight-next-line
                            "oidc.eks.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/id/84E95D704D69DB40F4E4B6B6A6777CA3:sub": "system:serviceaccount:otterize-tutorial-iam:server"
                        }
                    }
                }
            ]
        },
    [...]
}
}
```

#### The Kubernetes ServiceAccount was annotated with the role ARN
The credentials operator automatically annotated the Kubernetes ServiceAccount for the server pod with the newly created role ARN.

Let's look at the service account:
```bash
kubectl get serviceaccount -n otterize-tutorial-iam server -o yaml
```

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ServiceAccount
metadata:
  annotations:
    # highlight-next-line
    eks.amazonaws.com/role-arn:
    # highlight-next-line
      arn:aws:iam::353146681200:role/otr-otterize-tutorial-iam.server@otterize-iam-eks-tutoria-ef91a7
  name: server
  namespace: otterize-tutorial-iam
```


### Apply intents to create the necessary IAM policy

By annotating the pod, we've created an IAM role. We now need to specify what we need to access, and the intents operator will create an IAM policy accordingly.

We will specify the following ClientIntents, granting the PutObject permission to the `otterize-tutorial-bucket` S3 bucket.
```yaml
{@include: ../../../../static/code-examples/aws-iam-eks/clientintents.yaml}
```

To apply these intents, run the following command:
```bash
kubectl apply -n otterize-tutorial-iam -f ${ABSOLUTE_URL}/code-examples/aws-iam-eks/clientintents.yaml
```

### The server can now upload files to S3!

Let's look at the server logs again to see that no more errors are being reported:
```bash
kubectl logs -f -n otterize-tutorial-iam deploy/server
```

```json
{
  # highlight-next-line
  "status":200,
  "host":"server",
  "method":"POST",
  "uri":"/upload"
}
```

Let's list the contents of the S3 bucket:
```bash
aws s3 ls $BUCKET_NAME
```

```bash
2023-11-17 20:43:05         19 testfile.0.txt
2023-11-17 20:42:35         19 testfile.1.txt
2023-11-17 20:42:45         19 testfile.2.txt
2023-11-17 20:42:55         19 testfile.3.txt
```

### What's next?

Try out some of the other quick tutorials to learn about how to use ClientIntents to manage network policies, Istio policies, PostgreSQL access, and more. You can use a single ClientIntents resource to specify all the access required for a pod.
