Otterize integrates with GitLab projects to automatically generate merge requests as application access requirements change in the cluster. This enables platform administrators to continuously align security requirements with code updates.

In this tutorial, you will:

- Deploy a sample application.
- Create a Git repository to store ClientIntents manifests.
- Integrate a new Git repository into Otterize Cloud and install Otterizeâ€™s GitLab app.
- Modify application communication patterns, thereby triggering Otterize to create a merge request with the updated ClientIntents.

## Prerequisites

### CLI tools
You will need the following CLI tools to set up the repository and export ClientIntents:

1. [Otterize CLI](https://docs.otterize.com/overview/installation#install-the-otterize-cli)
2. [GitLab CLI](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/cli)

After installation, log in  with `glab auth login` and select your preferred method for authentication. Ensure your account has the necessary permissions to create new repositories.

### Deploy Otterize


With a Kubernetes cluster ready, head over to [Otterize Cloud](https://app.otterize.com/) and navigate to the [integrations page](https://app.otterize.com/integrations) to deploy Otterize. Follow the provided instructions to integrate your cluster.

## Tutorial

### Deploy the application 

Use the following command to set up the tutorial namespace and deploy a sample application simulating a fantasy tabletop game. The application comprises several services responsible for different aspects of the game.

```yaml
kubectl apply -n otterize-tutorial-gitlab -f ${ABSOLUTE_URL}/code-examples/gitlab/all.yaml
```
<details>
    <summary>View Deployment</summary>

```yaml
{@include: ../../../../static/code-examples/gitlab/all.yaml}
```
</details>

Once the deployment is complete, you can view the application's network map on Otterize Cloud. Turn on `Assume default deny` under network policies, as shown in the picture below.

    src="/img/quick-tutorials/gitlab/visual-graph-assume-default-deny.png"
    alt="visual graph of default deny network policy"
    style={{width: 200}}
/>

The connections will turn red.

### Export and apply ClientIntents

Otterize can automatically generate application access rules based on the actual network traffic detected by the network-mapper.

Use the Otterize CLI tool to export the recommended intent definitions. You can also access these definitions directly from the Access Graph on Otterize Cloud.

```bash
mkdir otterize-tutorial-gitlab
cd otterize-tutorial-gitlab
mkdir intents
otterize network-mapper export -n otterize-tutorial-gitlab > ./intents/intents.yaml
```
<details>
    <summary>View intents.yaml</summary>

```yaml
apiVersion: k8s.otterize.com/v2alpha1
kind: ClientIntents
metadata:
  name: adventure
  namespace: otterize-tutorial-gitlab
spec:
  workload:
    name: adventure
  targets:
    - service:
        name: character-generator
    - service:
        name: monster-generator
    - service:
        name: quest-generator
    - service:
        name: treasure-generator
```
</details>

Next, secure the application's pods by applying these intents to the cluster.

```bash
kubectl apply -n otterize-tutorial-gitlab -f ./intents/intents.yaml
```
In the Access Graph, the *adventure* client is now allowed to access the protected services.

    src="/img/quick-tutorials/gitlab/protected-services.gif"
    alt="visual graph of cluster deployment with protected edges"
/>

### Create the GitLab repository

To ensure versioned records, create a GitLab repository, stage and commit the applied intents. Then push the changes to the main branch.

Make sure you are in the `otterize-tutorial-gitlab` directory before executing the following commands.

```bash
export GLAB_USER=$(glab api user | jq -r '.username')
glab repo create otterize-tutorial-gitlab --private
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial Intents"
git branch -M main

# for HTTPS access, use git remote add origin https://gitlab.com/$GLAB_USER/otterize-tutorial-gitlab.git
git remote add origin git@gitlab.com:$GLAB_USER/otterize-tutorial-gitlab.git
git push -u origin main
```

The repository can now be integrated to Otterize cloud to detect drifts in case of changes in traffic patterns.

### Add the GitLab repository to Otterize Cloud

:::tip
In this section, you will use the *main* branch to track ClientIntents changes. For production environments, we recommend monitoring traffic changes in other long-held branches, such as *development*, *test*, or *staging*. You can then deploy the new compiled ClientIntents in production with your preferred tool.
:::

To add the repository to Otterize Cloud, navigate to the [Integrations page](https://app.otterize.com/integrations).

1. Click `Add Integration`.
2. Select integration type: `GitLab`.
3. Provide the name *otterize-tutorial-gitlab* as the integration.
4. In the `On Trigger` section, select your Kubernetes cluster, and leave the other options set to the predefined defaults.
5. In the `Open merge request on` section, select the `Project` field, and provide the owner and organization names in the form: *<gitlab user name\>/otterize-tutorial-gitlab*.
6. Select the `Base Branch` field, and enter *main*.
7. Select the `ClientIntents path` field, and enter `intents`. It represents the relative path hosting the ClientIntents manifests.
8. Next, click the `Add` button. This will redirect you to GitLab. If needed, click `Authorize` to authorize the Otterize Cloud GitLab app to use your account.

<img className="tw-w-96 tw-block tw-mx-auto tw-mb-4"
    src="/img/quick-tutorials/gitlab/authorize-gitlab-app.png"
    alt="GitLab App Authorize Example"
/>

The Otterize GitLab app is now installed in your account. Otterize will continuously monitor for differences between the ClientIntents definitions in your repository and the actual usage detected in your cluster. If drifts are detected, merge requests will be automatically opened to update the intent definitions and reflect the new usage behaviors.

You can learn more about GitLab configuration and how to use the Triggers on the [Reference page](/features/gitlab/reference)

### Update the application

In the original deployment, the game simulation's *adventure* pod utilized the *monster-generator* pod to fetch a random monster. An improved version, *monster-generator-v2*, has just been released and is ready for deployment.

```bash
kubectl apply -n otterize-tutorial-gitlab -f ${ABSOLUTE_URL}/code-examples/gitlab/all-v2.yaml
```

Once the pod is deployed, check the logs of the *adventure* pod using the command below. It should reflect the new application version.

```bash
kubectl logs -f -n otterize-tutorial-gitlab deploy/adventure
```

Here is an example of the expected output.

```
****************************************************
Let another great adventure begin!
****************************************************
Using MonsterV2 generated monster
Welcome to your adventure, Elf Wizard!
Your quest: Escort the Caravan
Beware, a wild Elephant appears!
The Elephant has 90 hit points, Our Elf has 244 points.
---------------------------------------------
Elf lands a 19 point strike against the smelly Beast!
Elephant hits our strong Elf doing 20 point of damage.
The Elephant has 71 hit points, Our Elf has 224 points.
```

*monster-generator-v2* is now displayed in Otterize Cloud Access Graph.

### Check for a new merge request

Following the introduction of a new application component, the network-mapper has detected a new connection and updated Otterize cloud. This update has triggered the GitLab integration, resulting in the submission of a new merge request.

<img
    src="/img/quick-tutorials/gitlab/merge-request.png"
    alt="GitLab merge request"
/>

Finally, merge the merge request and deploy the updated ClientIntents manifest.

```text
glab mr merge 1 -y
kubectl apply -n otterize-tutorial-gitlab -f ./intents/intents.yaml
```

## Teardown

Delete the application.

```*bash*
kubectl delete namespace otterize-tutorial-gitlab
```

Delete the Git repository with the following command:

```bash
glab repo delete $GLAB_USER/otterize-tutorial-gitlab
```
:::note
If your API doesn't grant *delete* privileges, navigate to the repository's *Settings* section to delete it manually.
:::

Finally, you can delete your local copy of the repository.

```bash
cd ..
rm -rf otterize-tutorial-gitlab
```
