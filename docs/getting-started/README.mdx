Otterize is a platform for implementing intent-based access control ([IBAC](/intent-based-access-control)) for workloads.
The platform is composed of **Otterize OSS**, which is tailored for a single Kubernetes cluster, and **Otterize Cloud**, which offers a unified control plane that can be deployed across Kubernetes clusters and non-Kubernetes infrastructures.

Otterize enables platform engineers to easily implement, expand, and unify secured access for their Kubernetes workloads.
## Let's go!

### Build confidence
Quickly deploy an ecommerce application with multiple services and learn how to manage it with
* [Network policies](/quick-tutorials/gain-confidence/shadow-mode-network-policies) - use shadow mode to boost confidence when rolling out secure access.
* [Secure access to Kafka](/quick-tutorials/gain-confidence/visualize-kafka-protection) - visualize kafka configuration and changes.

### Or try it for yourself
Dive right in and
* [Create and manage network policies](/quick-tutorials/try-now/k8s-network-policies)
* [Configure secure access for Kafka](/quick-tutorials/try-now/k8s-kafka-mtls)
* [Get full visibility into pod-to-pod traffic](/quick-tutorials/try-now/k8s-network-mapper)
* [Rollout mTLS](/quick-tutorials/try-now/k8s-mtls)

## Components

### Otterize OSS
The Otterize OSS components are standalone open-source projects that implement intent-based access control (IBAC) for a single Kubernetes cluster. This same set of components is used to integrate with Otterize Cloud.
- [Otterize intents operator](concepts/otterize-oss/componentsintents-operator) translates ClientIntents resources to access controls: currently, network policies for pod-to-pod access, and ACLs for in-cluster Kafka client access.

- [Otterize credential operator](concepts/otterize-oss/componentsspire-integration-operator) integrates with SPIFFE/SPIRE to handle pod identities and manage certificates.

- [Otterize network mapper](concepts/otterize-oss/componentsnetwork-mapper) sniffs pod-to-pod traffic and builds a network map, which is useful on its own and may also be exported as client intents files for bootstrapping IBAC.

### Otterize CLI

The [Otterize CLI](/reference/cli) is used to control the network mapper, work with non-Kubernetes client
intents files (optional when working with Otterize OSS), and for interfacing with the Otterize Cloud.

## Open source and cloud

### Otterize OSS

Otterize OSS is a standalone open-source implementation of intent-based access control (IBAC) for a single Kubernetes cluster. As well as being open source, Otterize OSS is completely free, licensed under the Apache 2.0 license and does not require Otterize Cloud.

### Otterize Cloud

Otterize Cloud adds a unified control plane that offers visibility and operationalization,
and spans multiple Kubernetes clusters as well as non-Kubernetes infrastructures.
