Otterize is a platform for implementing intent-based access control ([IBAC](/intent-based-access-control)) for workloads.
The platform is composed of **Otterize OSS**, which is tailored for a single Kubernetes cluster, and **Otterize Cloud**, which adds visibility and operationalization across Kubernetes clusters and non-Kubernetes infrastructures.

Otterize enables platform engineers to easily implement, expand, and unify secured access for their Kubernetes workloads.
## Let's go!
Dive right in with simple demos to:
* [Create and manage network policies](/quick-tutorials/k8s-network-policies).
* [Configure secure access for Kafka](/quick-tutorials/k8s-kafka-mtls).
* [Get full visibility into pod-to-pod traffic](/quick-tutorials/k8s-network-mapper).
* [Roll out mTLS](/quick-tutorials/k8s-mtls).

Or, just as quickly and a bit more visually, use a demo ecommerce application to:
* [Discover its access graph, including pod-to-pod traffic and access status](/quick-visual-tutorials/visual-k8s-cluster-mapping).
* [Gradually roll out IBAC with network policies, first in shadow mode and then with enforcement](/quick-visual-tutorials/visual-ibac-network-policies).
* [Gradually roll out IBAC for Kafka](/quick-visual-tutorials/visual-ibac-kafka-k8s).


## Components

### Otterize OSS
The Otterize OSS components are standalone open-source projects that implement intent-based access control (IBAC) for a single Kubernetes cluster. This same set of components is used to integrate with Otterize Cloud.
- The [Otterize intents operator](/reference/configuration/intents-operator) translates ClientIntents resources to access controls: currently, network policies for pod-to-pod access, and ACLs for in-cluster Kafka client access. [See it in GitHub](https://github.com/otterize/intents-operator)
- The [Otterize credentials operator](/reference/configuration/credentials-operator) integrates with SPIFFE/SPIRE to handle pod identities and manage certificates. [See it in GitHub](https://github.com/otterize/credentials-operator)
- The [Otterize network mapper](/reference/configuration/network-mapper) sniffs pod-to-pod traffic and builds a network map, which is useful on its own and may also be exported as client intents files for bootstrapping IBAC. [See it in GitHub](https://github.com/otterize/network-mapper)


### Otterize CLI

The [Otterize CLI](/reference/cli) is used to control the network mapper or output its data, convert non-Kubernetes client
intents files (if needed) to Kubernetes custom resource YAMLs, interface with the Otterize Cloud.

## Open source and Cloud

### Otterize OSS

Otterize OSS is a standalone open-source implementation of intent-based access control (IBAC) for a single Kubernetes cluster. As well as being open source, Otterize OSS is completely free, licensed under the Apache 2.0 license and does not require Otterize Cloud.

### Otterize Cloud

Otterize Cloud adds unified visibility and operationalization,
and spans multiple Kubernetes clusters as well as (coming soon) non-Kubernetes infrastructures.
