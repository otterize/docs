### Otterize OSS

Otterize OSS implements intent-based access control in a single Kubernetes cluster.

It consists of the intents operator, a Kubernetes operator which handles client intents, and translates those intents to effective access control &mdash; at the moment, through network policies and through Kafka ACLs. It also
includes the SPIRE integration operator, a Kubernetes operator for integrating with SPIFFE/SPIRE to handle pod identities
and manage certificates. Finally, we have the network mapper to sniff pod-to-pod traffic
and build a map, that may be exported to client intents files.

### Otterize Cloud <div class="coming-soon-h2">Coming soon</div>

While Otterize OSS operates within a Kubernetes cluster,
Otterize Cloud adds a unified control plane that offers visibility and operationalization,
and spans multiple Kubernetes clusters as well as non-Kubernetes infrastructures.

Read more in our [product page](https://otterize.com/product).

### Otterize CLI

Otterize OSS works within the common Kubernetes tool ecosystem, such as `kubectl` and
Helm; e.g., you can directly `kubectl apply` client intents files that are
formatted as Kubernetes resources. The Otterize CLI is used to control the network mapper, work with non-Kubernetes client
intents files (optional when working with Otterize OSS), and for interfacing with the Otterize Cloud.

## Getting started with Otterize OSS

It's easy to get started with Otterize OSS, 
whether you have 5 minutes to go through a quick pre-built tutorial, 
or 10 minutes to try it on your own services or on our "lab".

### Got 5 minutes?

Try it out with our simple pre-built examples. All you need is a Kubernetes cluster where you have admin rights, along with the standard Kubernetes toolset:
* `kubectl`
* Helm 3

And with that &mdash; <LinkButton href="/quick-tutorials/k8s-network-policies">onwards to the first tutorial</LinkButton>!

### Got 10 minutes?

Try it out with your own services, or use our larger reference "lab" example.
Again, you just need the standard tools:
* `kubectl`
* Helm 3

Then just start with <LinkButton href="/guides">the usecase that's interesting to you</LinkButton>.
