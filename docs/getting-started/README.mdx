### Otterize OSS

Otterize OSS is a standalone open-source implementation of intent-based access control (IBAC) for a single Kubernetes cluster. As well as being open source, Otterize OSS is completely free, licensed under the Apache 2.0 license and does not require Otterize Cloud.

Want to try it out? [Skip to getting started with Otterize OSS](#getting-started-with-otterize-oss).

Otterize OSS consists of several components:
- The [Otterize intents operator](concepts/otterize-oss/componentsintents-operator) that translates ClientIntents resources to
access controls: currently, network policies for pod-to-pod access, and ACLs for in-cluster Kafka client access.
- The [Otterize SPIRE integration operator](concepts/otterize-oss/componentsspire-integration-operator) that integrates with SPIFFE/SPIRE
to handle pod identities and manage certificates.
- The [Otterize network mapper](concepts/otterize-oss/componentsnetwork-mapper) that sniffs pod-to-pod traffic and builds a network map,
which is useful on its own and may also be exported as client intents files for bootstrapping IBAC.


### Otterize Cloud <div class="coming-soon-h2">Coming soon</div>

While Otterize OSS operates within a Kubernetes cluster,
Otterize Cloud adds a unified control plane that offers visibility and operationalization,
and spans multiple Kubernetes clusters as well as non-Kubernetes infrastructures.

Read more in our [product page](https://otterize.com/product).

### Otterize CLI

Otterize OSS works within the common Kubernetes tool ecosystem, such as `kubectl` and
Helm; e.g., you can directly `kubectl apply` client intents files that are
formatted as Kubernetes resources. The Otterize CLI is used to control the network mapper, work with non-Kubernetes client
intents files (optional when working with Otterize OSS), and for interfacing with the Otterize Cloud.

## Getting started with Otterize OSS

It's easy to get started with Otterize OSS, 
whether you have 5 minutes to go through a quick pre-built tutorial, 
or 10 minutes to try it on your own services or on our "lab".

### Got 5 minutes?

Try it out with our simple pre-built examples. All you need is a Kubernetes cluster where you have admin rights, along with the standard Kubernetes toolset:
* `kubectl`
* Helm 3

And with that &mdash; <LinkButton href="/quick-tutorials/k8s-network-policies">onwards to the first tutorial</LinkButton>!

### Got 10 minutes?

Try it out with your own services, or use our larger reference "lab" example.
Again, you just need the standard tools:
* `kubectl`
* Helm 3

Then just start with <LinkButton href="/guides">the usecase that's interesting to you</LinkButton>.
