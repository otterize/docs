title: Otterize Cloud
---

Otterize Cloud provides a cloud-based control plane for deploying and managing [intents-based access control (IBAC)](https://otterize.com/ibac).

It currently supports IBAC within Kubernetes clusters, configuring access between pods and access to Kafka nodes using network policies and Kafka ACLs.
Soon, Otterize Cloud will also support IBAC across clusters and non-Kubernetes services and resources (e.g. standalone and managed Kafka, RDS, etc.).
This page is focused on the current capabilities of Otterize Cloud.

## What it does

Otterize Cloud attaches to [Otterize OSS](/otterize-oss) operators (the intents operator, network mapper, and credentials operator) running in your Kubernetes clusters.
While Otterize OSS does the heavy lifting &mdash; mapping pod-to-pod traffic, responding to intents files applied with `kubectl` and
configuring network policies and Kafka ACLs &mdash; Otterize Cloud adds:
- **Visibility**: visualize the network map of any connected cluster.
- **Confidence**: run Otterize OSS in **shadow mode**, i.e. without enforcement, and see what *would* happen when you turn on enforcement.
- **Operationalization**:
  - Map namespaces to environments to see everything in the language of development cycle.
  - Use the (optional) Otterize Cloud identity service instead of operating SPIRE yourself (the default for standalone Otterize OSS).

## The access graph

Otterize Cloud collects information from Otterize OSS, including the declared intents of clients to call servers ("discovered intents"),
the implied intents of clients actually calling servers ("discovered intents"), certificate information, and various configurations.
All of this is presented in a unified, filtered view called the **access graph**: a knowledge graph of which services call each other,
are they blocked or would they be blocked if enforcement were turned on, are they protected, and how are they configured.

The access graph **continuously** reflects the state of your cluster, as reported by the Otterize OSS operators. Any changes made in the cluster appear in real time in Otterize Cloud.

:::tip
Otterize Cloud **reads** information from your cluster via Otterize OSS (when the latter is deployed with Otterize Cloud credentials)
but Otterize Cloud **does not write** anything to your cluster: any modifications to your cluster only occur because of changes you make locally within your cluster.

For example, to change between shadow mode (no enforcement) and active enforcement mode, you change the Otterize intents operator configuration locally in your cluster, and redeploy it.

### Filters

The access graph may be viewed for one **cluster** at a time. Within a cluster, you may filter by **environment** and by **namespace**.

The access graph shows all the services discovered in the selected cluster that meet the filter criteria. Services are discovered in one of two ways:
- Via the network mapper, which collects pod-to-pod connections (attempted and successful) and builds a network map of "discovered intents".
- Via the intents operator, which reports intents declared by (client) services to call (server) services, applied via `kubectl`.

*Note: currently, services that have neither discovered nor applied intents attached to them at all will not appear in the access graph. This will be addressed soon.*

Since discovered intents history is kept indefinitely, the access graph will eventually contain services that are no longer relevant.
To filter out old discovered intents and the services that only appear because of them, use the "**Since:**" filter.

### Understanding the access graph

When viewing the access graph for a cluster, the cluster's state is displayed at the top, to help you better understand the access graph.

<details>
<summary>You can easily tell whether whether all operators are <b>connected or not</b>.</summary>
For example, if either the network mapper or the intents operator is not connected,
the access graph will not be able to compare the discovered intents with the explicitly declared and applied intents and show what calls are or would be blocked.
</details>
<details>
<summary>You can tell whether the operators are in <b>active</b> or <b>shadow</b> mode.</summary>

- If active, they are managing network policies and Kafka ACLs to enforce access controls (and authorize intended access).

- In shadow mode, you can build confidence in your IBAC rollout by seeing what would happen before you turn on enforcement.

</details>
<details>
<summary>You can tell Otterize Cloud more about your cluster's non-Otterize configuration.</summary>

- If you've set up a <b>global default deny</b> network policy that only allows pod-to-pod access if an explicit pod-to-pod network policy allows it, check this box.
The access graph will know that services are always protected unless those explicit policies are in place, and will show blocking information accordingly.
Note that the access graph assumes that Otterize is managing any (ingress) network policies beyond this global default deny.

- If you aren't interested in using network policies at all, uncheck "<b>Use network policies to calculate access graph</b>".
The access graph will not take network policies into account when calculating service and intents states,
and will not show alerts or recommendations related to network policies.

The access graph combines all the information about the Kubernetes cluster and the services and intents in it to show you insights about service to service access.

Here is the meaning of the various service and access states &mdash; the nodes and edges of the graph:
