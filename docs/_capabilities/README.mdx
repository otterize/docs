These guides take you in some depth through using Otterize in various scenarios.

They are oriented to solving specific use cases:

- #### [Automatically controlling K8s pod-to-pod access via network policies](/capabilities/network-policies)

- #### [Easily and securely accessing Kafka with mTLS and ACLs](/capabilities/kafka)

- #### [Mapping service-to-service calls in your K8s cluster, and bootstrapping intents files](/capabilities/k8s-mapping-pod-to-pod-calls)

By following these guides, you will learn not only how to take an intent-based approach to streamlining access control,
but also how to **bootstrap** intents files to get your team started,
and **gradually roll out IBAC** service-by-service or team-by-team.
