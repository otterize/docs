# ClientIntents: Differences Between v1alpha3 and v2alpha1

This document highlights the differences in the `ClientIntents` Custom Resource Definition (CRD) specification between `v1alpha3` and `v2alpha1`. It provides a detailed breakdown of each part of the `spec` and outlines what has changed.

## Overview of Key Differences

The `v2alpha1` version introduces:
- More structured and streamlined target definitions.
- Unified field names for consistency across all target types.
- Simplifications in defining certain resource-specific details.

### `service` (Renamed to `workload`)
#### `v1alpha3`
```yaml
service:
  name: <string>
```

**Fields**:
  - `name`: Represents the name of the client workload initiating requests.

**Purpose**: Defines the client workload initiating requests.

#### `v2alpha1`
```yaml
workload:
  name: <string>
  kind: <string>
```

**Fields**:
  - `name`: Name of the client workload initiating requests.
  - `kind`: The type of workload, such as `Deployment` or `StatefulSet`.

**Changes**:
  - The field is renamed from `service` to `workload`.
  - A new `kind` field is added to specify the workload type (e.g., `Deployment`, `StatefulSet`).

---

### `calls` (Renamed to `targets`)
#### `v1alpha3`
```yaml
calls:
  - name: <string>
```

**Fields**:
  - `name`: Represents the  target resource (e.g., service name, ARN, scope).

**Purpose**: Defines the resources that the workload interacts with.
#### `v2alpha1`
```yaml
targets:
  - <target-type>:
      ...
```

**Changes**:
  - The field is renamed from `calls` to `targets`.
  - Targets are explicitly categorized into resource types (`kubernetes`, `service`, `kafka`, `sql`, etc.).
  - Each target type now has its own structured definition.

---

### Inter Service Communication
#### `v1alpha3`
```yaml
cals:
  - name: <name>[.<namespace>]
```

**Fields**:
  - `name`: Represents the target service name (and optional namespace).It represents the resource owning the pods of the target service (such as Deployment, StatefulSet, etc.).

**Purpose**: Defines the target service for inter-service communication (will be translated to NetworkPolicies or mesh policies).

#### `v2alpha1`
```yaml
targets:
  - kubernetes:
      name: <string>[.<namespace>]
      kind: <string>
  - service:
      name: <string>[.<namespace>]
```

**Fields**:
  - `kubernetes`: Target is a Kubernetes resource.
    - `name`: The name of the target Kubernetes resource.
    - `kind`: The kind of Kubernetes resource (e.g., `Deployment`, `StatefulSet`).
  - `service`: Target is a Kubernetes Service. It's equivalent to the `kubernetes` target with `kind: Service`.
    - `name`: The name of the target Service.

**Changes**:
    - Explicitly defines the target resource type (Kubernetes resource or Service).


### HTTP Resources (Simplified)
#### `v1alpha3`
```yaml
calls:
  - name: <string>
    HTTPResources:
      - path: <string>
        methods: [<string>, ...]
```

**Purpose**: Defines HTTP resources accessed by the workload.

#### `v2alpha1`
```yaml
targets:
  - kubernetes:
      name: <string>
      kind: Service
      http:
        - path: <string>
          methods: [<string>, ...]
```

**Changes**:
  - `HTTPResources` is replaced by `http` under the respective target type (`kubernetes` or `service`).
  - This change simplifies the hierarchy and aligns HTTP definitions with other target-specific fields.

### Kafka (No Major Changes)
#### `v1alpha3`
```yaml
calls:
  - name: <string>
    kafkaTopics:
      - name: <string>

**Purpose**: Represents the interaction with Kafka clusters.

#### `v2alpha1`
```yaml
targets:
  - kafka:
      name: <string>
      topics:
        - name: <string>
          operations: [<string>, ...]
```

**Fields**:
  - `kafka`: Represents Kafka Target.
- `name`: The name of the Kafka cluster.
- `topics`: A list of Kafka topics and allowed operations.
- `name`: The name of the topic.
- `operations`: Allowed operations on the topic (e.g., `produce`, `consume`).

**Changes**:
  - Structurally, Kafka definitions remain the same.

### SQL Databases (Renamed to `sql`)
#### `v1alpha3`
```yaml
calls:
  - name: <string>
    databaseResources:
      - databaseName: <string>
        table: <string>

  - `name`: Represents the SQL database target.
  - `databaseResources`: A list of database-specific resources.
- `databaseName`: The name of the target database.

#### `v2alpha1`
```yaml
targets:

      name: <string>
      privileges:
        - databaseName: <string>
          table: <string>
          operations: [<string>, ...]
```
