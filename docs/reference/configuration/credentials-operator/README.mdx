title: Credentials operator
---

The Otterize credentials operator automatically resolves pods to dev-friendly service names, registers them with a SPIRE server or with Otterize Cloud, and provisions credentials as Kubernetes Secrets.

## Deploying the credentials operator
To deploy the operator, [use the Helm chart](/reference/configuration/credentials-operator/helm-chart).

## Acquiring mTLS credentials using the credentials operator
The credentials operator is controlled using annotations placed on pods. To have it provision credentials and place them in Secrets, you must specify `credentials-operator.otterize.com/tls-secret-name`.

## SPIRE workload registrar
When using SPIRE, the operator registers every pod (even those without annotations).
Alongside the credentials operator, you could use SPIRE agents and the SPIRE SDK to work with the same SPIRE server.
To learn more, check out the documentation for [SPIRE](https://spiffe.io/docs/latest/spire-about/spire-concepts/). Note that to use the credentials operator, you do not need to work directly with SPIRE or SPIRE agents, and can do everything completely using annotations and Kubernetes Secrets.


### Pod annotations

| Annotation                                                          | Description                                                                                                                                                          | Default                                                   |

## How does the credentials operator work?

### SPIRE entry registration
Once the operator [resolves the service name](#service-name-resolution-and-automatic-pod-labeling) for a pod, it labels the pod and registers an entry with the SPIRE server.
If configured to use Otterize Cloud credentials instead of SPIRE (`global.certificateProvider=otterize-cloud` in the Helm chart configuration), it registers the Otterize service with Otterize Cloud.

### Credential generation
The operator consults the label `credentials-operator.otterize.com/tls-secret-name`. If that label exists, the operator creates a secret named after the value of the label with X.509 credentials within, provided by SPIRE or Otterize Cloud, depending on how the credentials operator is configured. This way, the pod can get autogenerated credentials without modifying its code.

When using SPIRE, once the operator has registered the pod with SPIRE, which happens automatically upon startup, the pod can use the SPIRE Workload API to generate credentials for the SVID `<servicename>.<namespace>`.

### Service name resolution and automatic pod labeling
The operator performs service name resolution for each pod. You can read more about the resolution algorithm [here](/reference/service-identities#kubernetes-service-identity-resolution).
The value resulting from this resolution process forms the value of the label `credentials-operator.otterize.com/service-name`.
