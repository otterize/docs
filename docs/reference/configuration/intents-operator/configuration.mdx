title: Configuring Kafka brokers
---

The intents operator is able to create network policies with zero configuration. But in order to apply Kafka ACLs to a Kafka broker, the operator must know how to connect.

To tell the operator how to do so, you must create a `KafkaServerConfig` resource. It is recommended to create this resource in the same namespace as the Kafka broker,
and manage its lifespan alongside the broker. If you deploy a chart that deploys a Kafka broker, or another resource that deploys a broker, you should deploy this `KafkaServerConfig` alongside those.

Here is an annotated example of a `KafkaServerConfig`, followed by an in-depth explanation for each section.

## Full annotated example
```yaml
apiVersion: k8s.otterize.com/v1alpha2
kind: KafkaServerConfig
metadata:
  name: kafkabroker  # the name of the KafkaServerConfig resource
spec:
  service:
    name: ecomm-events # the name of the Otterize service, as it would appear in ClientIntents as the destination.
  addr: ecommevents.namespace:9092 # the address the intents operator will connect to in order to apply ACLs to this broker
  noAutoCreateIntentsForOperator: false # By default, the operator automatically creates a ClientIntent for itself to this server, so that it's able to connect. To disable, set to "true".
  tls: # this section informs the operator where to find the credentials to authenticate with the broker via mTLS. The values here are the defaults set by the otterize-kubernetes chart.
    certFile: /etc/otterize-spire/svid.pem
    keyFile: /etc/otterize-spire/key.pem
    rootCAFile: /etc/otterize-spire/bundle.pem
  topics: # configuration for topic scope - how ACLs should be applied to each topic or set of topics.
    - topic: "*" # A specific topic or a prefix. Can be "*" for all.
      pattern: literal # Prefix or literal. Use literal for "*".
      clientIdentityRequired: false # Whether client identity is required. If set to true to, access by anonymous users will be denied.
      intentsRequired: false # Whether intents are required - if set to true, all access will be denied unless intents are declared
```

### Service name
The name of the service as it appears in ClientIntents.
For example:
```yaml
apiVersion: k8s.otterize.com/v1alpha2
kind: ClientIntents
[...]
spec:
[...]
  calls:
    - name: ecomm-events # here!
      type: kafka
```

### Address (`addr`)
The address the intents operator will connect to in order to apply and remove ACLs resulting from `ClientIntents` and the KafkaServerConfig's `topics` section.

### Disable auto create intents for operator (`noAutoCreateIntentsForOperator`)
By default, the operator automatically creates a ClientIntent for itself to this server, so that it's able to connect. The default value for this configuration is `false`. To disable, set to `true`.

### TLS
Where the intents operator will find credentials mounted to its pod to authenticate with the Kafka broker.
If using the `otterize-kubernetes` chart, the values in the example above are correct.

### Topic scope

Using topic scope, you can gradually roll out Otterize to your Kafka cluster. Select a subset of topics to apply mTLS and/or intents to and start with those, without affecting the rest.

- Unauthenticated - client identity not required:
 ```bash
 clientIdentityRequired: false
 intentsRequired: false
   ```
- Authenticated - client identity required:
 ```bash
 clientIdentityRequired: true
 intentsRequired: false
   ```
- Authorized - client identity and an intent are required:
 ```bash
 clientIdentityRequired: true
 intentsRequired: true
   ```


Here are example configurations for topic scope and the resulting ACLs.

#### Allow unauthenticated access to all topics
```yaml title="Topic scope"
- topic: "*"
  pattern: literal
  clientIdentityRequired: false
  intentsRequired: false
```
```yaml title="Kafka ACL"
(none)
```

#### Allow authenticated access to `mytopic` (or deny all unauthenticated access)
```yaml title="Topic scope"
- topic: "mytopic"
  pattern: literal
  clientIdentityRequired: true
  intentsRequired: false
```
```yaml title="Kafka ACL"
ResourcePattern(resourceType=TOPIC, name=mytopic, patternType=LITERAL), versionedAcls :
Set(User:ANONYMOUS has DENY permission for operations: ALL from hosts: *,
    User:* has ALLOW permission for operations: ALL from hosts: *)
```

#### Allow intended access to `mytopic-intended` with a `topic scope` and an `intent`
Otterize generates two ACLs for this access pattern:
1. The topic scope will generate an ACL to block all access to the topic at first.
2. The intent will set a specific ACL to allow the caller to access the topic.

If you set the topic scope in the KSC as follows:
```yaml title="Topic scope"
- topic: "mytopic-intended"
  pattern: literal
  clientIdentityRequired: true
  intentsRequired: true
```

Otterize will generate this ACL:

```yaml title="Kafka ACL"
ResourcePattern(resourceType=TOPIC, name=mytopic-intended, patternType=LITERAL), versionedAcls :
Set(User:ANONYMOUS has DENY permission for operations: ALL from hosts: *)
```

And when you declare and apply this intent:

```yaml title="Intent"
service:
    name: interactive
  calls:
    - name: kafka.kafka
      type: kafka
      topics:
        - name: mytopic-intended
          operations: [ all ]
```

Otterize will add this ACL:

```yaml title="Kafka ACL"
ResourcePattern(resourceType=TOPIC, name=mytopic-intended, patternType=LITERAL), versionedAcls :
Set(User:ANONYMOUS has DENY permission for operations: ALL from hosts: *,
    User:CN=interactive.ibac-for-kafka,O=SPIRE,C=US has ALLOW permission for operations: ALL from hosts: *)
```

Together, these ACLs will ensure that only clients that have applied intents will be able to access the specific topic.
