[Network policies](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/network-policies/) are one of the tools we
can use for traffic shaping within K8s clusters. They allow us to shape traffic using selectors, policies, and L3
and L4 identifiers. To enforce network policies, a Kubernetes cluster requires a CNI supporting network policies to be
installed. Some popular options are Calico and Cilium.

## Closer look at a network policy
Let's take a look at an example showing a network policy allowing traffic:
- From pods labeled **app:backend** in namespaces labeled **env:production**.
- To pods labeled **app:db** in the namespace  **production-db**.

```yaml
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: NetworkPolicy
metadata:
  name: allow-production-backend
  # highlight-next-line
  namespace: production-db            # [Target filter] applies to pods in this namespace
spec:
  podSelector:
    matchLabels:
      # highlight-next-line
      app: db                         # [Target filter] applies to pods with this label
  policyTypes:
    # highlight-next-line
    - Ingress                         # [Direction] implemented as a filter on incoming connections
  ingress:
    - from:
        - namespaceSelector:
            matchLabels:
              # highlight-next-line
              env: production         # [Source filter] applies to namespaces with this label
        - podSelector:
            matchLabels:
              # highlight-next-line
              app: backend            # [Source filter] applies to pods with this label
```

## Setting security scope via default network policies

Two common approaches for working with network policies are:

- Allow all traffic between pods, protect some pods by applying ingress network policies to them.
- Block all traffic between pods except allowed traffic by network policies.

You can apply both approaches (allow/block all) within your cluster (e.g. by applying network policies based on
namespaces).

## Default deny network policy
To block all traffic within a namespace, you can apply a default deny network policy to that namespace. After applying this policy, only traffic allowed by network policies, such as those generated automatically from ClientIntents, will be allowed within that namespace.

Such a policy only blocks ingress traffic, so it does not prevent pods from connecting to the Internet. Enforcement is performed at the ingress to pods. This is appropriate for achieving in-cluster service-to-service zero trust and network segmentation within a namespace.

Here is such a policy that you can apply to any namespace:

```yaml
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: NetworkPolicy
metadata:
  name: default-deny-ingress
spec:
  podSelector: { }
  policyTypes:
    - Ingress
```

## Global ingress default deny policy with Calico
If using Calico as your CNI for network policies, you can deploy a global (cluster-wide, across multiple namespaces), ingress-type default deny network policy. After applying this policy, only traffic allowed by network policies, such as those generated automatically from ClientIntents, will be allowed throughout the cluster.

It's important to exempt Otterize and Calico and the Kubernetes infrastructure itself from this policy, so they can function correctly by receiving calls from the Kubernetes API server.

Such a policy only blocks ingress traffic, so it does not prevent pods from connecting to the Internet. Enforcement is performed at the ingress to pods. This is appropriate for achieving in-cluster service-to-service zero trust and network segmentation across an entire cluster.

```yaml
apiVersion: projectcalico.org/v3
kind: GlobalNetworkPolicy
metadata:
  name: global-deny-ingress
spec:
  # highlight-next-line
  # Exclude kube-system, calico-system, calico-apiserver and otterize-system
  namespaceSelector: has(projectcalico.org/name) && projectcalico.org/name not in {"kube-system", "calico-system", "calico-apiserver", "otterize-system"}
  types:
  # highlight-next-line
  - Ingress # Ingress-only
```

## Tip: Using a global *egress* default deny policy with Calico
If using Calico for network policies, you might choose to deploy a global(cluster-wide, across multiple namespaces) default **egress** deny network policy, in order to restrict egress traffic going out of the cluster. If so, it is important to exempt Otterize and Calico from this policy so that they are able to function correctly.
Also, note that Otterize-managed network policies only apply to traffic within the cluster.

To work well with an ingress default deny policy, an egress policy should not prevent traffic within the cluster &mdash; the global default deny ingress policy will already block all in-cluster traffic by default, and ClientIntents will then allow intended traffic.

Here is an example of how you can achieve this by explicitly allowlisting certain pod IPs. You will need to substitute the appropriate IPs for your pods. This is usually part of your CNI or cluster configuration.

```yaml
apiVersion: projectcalico.org/v3
kind: GlobalNetworkPolicy
metadata:
  name: default-deny-egress
spec:
  namespaceSelector: has(projectcalico.org/name) && projectcalico.org/name not in {"kube-system", "calico-system", "calico-apiserver"}
  types:
  - Egress
  egress:
   # Allow all namespaces to communicate to DNS pods
  - action: Allow
    protocol: UDP
    destination:
      selector: 'k8s-app == "kube-dns"'
      ports: ["53"]
    # Allow all namespaces to talk to the internet on port 443
  - action: Allow
    protocol: TCP
    destination:
      nets: ["0.0.0.0/0"]
      ports: ["443"]
    # Allow all namespaces to talk on egress to any port inside the cluster or in the VPC.
    # Effectively, ingress default deny would still block any intra-cluster traffic
    # not explicitly allowed by a dedicated network policy.
  - action: Allow
    protocol: TCP
    destination:
    # highlight-start
    # update these IP addresses to match your pods
      nets: ["10.0.0.0/16","172.20.0.0/16"]
    # highlight-end
```

## Working with third-party Helm charts and a default deny policy
After applying a default deny policy, you will need network policies for intended traffic to go through.
The Otterize network mapper generates ClientIntents for your cluster, but we recommend you use ClientIntents for services that are functional clients, rather than purely operational infrastructure (e.g. `checkoutservice` is a client, while Prometheus is purely operational infrastructure). So you will need to enable traffic to/from such infrastructure outside of Otterize.

Many third-party Helm charts come with a ready-made network policy to use when deployed into a cluster that uses a default deny policy. Simply enable them using the values found in the chart.

:::tip
We recommend using these explicit network policies rather than ClientIntents, as this relieves the infrastructure or platform team in your organization from maintaining ClientIntents for infrastructure services: instead, the Helm chart will always have the most accurate infrastructural network policies.

## Auto-generating network policies for external traffic
The intents operator defaults to automatically generate network policies for Kubernetes **Services** (type **LoadBalancer** and **NodePort**), and Ingress traffic
when an intent will generate a network policy that can block external traffic. To disable this feature, consult the [documentation for the intents operator](/reference/configuration/intents-operator).


Let's look at an example from our demo. We have a **frontend** service being accessed from multiple sources:
- **loadgenerator** calls it from within the cluster to generate traffic, by accessing the **frontend** **ClusterIP Service**.
- **frontend-external** is a **Service** with type **LoadBalancer** directing traffic from outside the cluster to the frontend pods. The **LoadBalancer** type means that a cloud provider load balancer will be created and point traffic from the Internet to these pods.

By applying the following intents file:
```yaml
apiVersion: k8s.otterize.com/v1alpha2
kind: ClientIntents
metadata:
  name: loadgenerator
spec:
  service:
    name: loadgenerator
  calls:
    - name: frontend
```
Otterize will generate a network policy allowing access from the **loadgenerator** service to the **frontend** service.
Once a single network policy matches a pod, other traffic not allowed by existing network policies to the **frontend** will get blocked. In our
case that means that the **frontend-external** **LoadBalancer** won't be able to communicate with **frontend**.

To overcome this, Otterize will automatically generate a network policy to allow traffic from **frontend-external**
to **frontend** by relying on the existence of the **LoadBalancer Service** as an indicator of intent between the two.

Why doesn't Otterize always generate network policies for ingress types?
Because if no network policies exist, automatically generating a network policy to allow **frontend-external** -> **frontend**
would block existing traffic like **loadgenerator** -> **frontend**.



## How intents translate to network policies
Let's follow an example scenario and track how Otterize configures network policies when we apply intents.
### Deploy example
Our example consists of two pods: an HTTP server and a client that calls it.

<details>
<summary>Expand to see the example YAML files</summary>
<Tabs>

<TabItem value="namespace.yaml" label="namespace.yaml" default>

```yaml
{@include: ../../../static/code-examples/automate-network-policies/namespace.yaml}
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="server.yaml" label="server.yaml" default>

```yaml
{@include: ../../../static/code-examples/automate-network-policies/server-deployment.yaml}
---
{@include: ../../../static/code-examples/automate-network-policies/server-service.yaml}
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="client.yaml" label="client.yaml" default>

```yaml
{@include: ../../../static/code-examples/automate-network-policies/client-deployment.yaml}
```

</TabItem>

</Tabs>
</details>

1. Deploy the **client** and **server** using `kubectl`:

   ```shell
   kubectl apply -f https://docs.otterize.com/code-examples/automate-network-policies/all.yaml
   ```
2. Check that the **client** and **server** pods were deployed:
   ```bash
   kubectl get pods -n otterize-tutorial-npol
   ```
   You should see:
   ```
   NAME                      READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
   client-5689997b5c-grlnt   1/1     Running   0          35s
   server-6698c58cbc-v9n9b   1/1     Running   0          34s
   ```

3. The **client** intents to call the server are declared with this `intents.yaml` file:

```yaml
{@include: ../../../static/code-examples/automate-network-policies/intents.yaml}
```
   Let's apply it:
   ```shell
   kubectl apply -f https://docs.otterize.com/code-examples/automate-network-policies/intents.yaml
   ```

### Track artifacts
After applying the intents file Otterize performed multiple actions to allow access from the client to the server using network policies:
- Create a network policy allowing traffic from the [client, namespace -labeled] pods to [server-labeled] pods
- Label the client pods
- Label the client pod namespaces
- Label the server pods
1. Let's look at the generated network policy:
  ```bash
  kubectl describe networkpolicies -n otterize-tutorial-npol access-to-server-from-otterize-tutorial-npol
  ```
  You should see (without the comments):
  ```yaml
  Name:         access-to-server-from-otterize-tutorial-npol
  # [Target filter] namespace
  # highlight-next-line
  Namespace:    otterize-tutorial-npol
  Created on:   2022-09-08 19:12:24 +0300 IDT
  Labels:       intents.otterize.com/network-policy=true
  Annotations:  <none>
  Spec:
    # [Target filter] pods with this label
    # highlight-next-line
    PodSelector:     intents.otterize.com/server=server-otterize-tutorial-np-7e16db
    Allowing ingress traffic:
      To Port: <any> (traffic allowed to all ports)
      From:
        # [Source filter] namespaces with this label
        # highlight-next-line
        NamespaceSelector: intents.otterize.com/namespace-name=otterize-tutorial-npol
        # [Source filter] pods with this label
        # highlight-next-line
        PodSelector: intents.otterize.com/access-server-otterize-tutorial-np-7e16db=true
    Not affecting egress traffic
    # [Direction]
    # highlight-next-line
    Policy Types: Ingress
  ```
2. And we can also see that the client and server pods are now labeled:
  ```bash
  kubectl get pods -n otterize-tutorial-npol --show-labels
  ```
  You should see:
  ```bash
  NAME                      READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE     LABELS
  client-5cb67b748-l25vg    1/1     Running   0          7m57s   intents.otterize.com/access-server-otterize-tutorial-np-7e16db=true,intents.otterize.com/client=true,intents.otterize.com/server=client-otterize-tutorial-np-699302,pod-template-hash=5cb67b748,credentials-operator.otterize.com/service-name=client
  server-564b56f596-54str   1/1     Running   0          7m56s   intents.otterize.com/server=server-otterize-tutorial-np-7e16db,pod-template-hash=564b56f596,credentials-operator.otterize.com/service-name=server
  ```

  When we break down the label structure we can see:
  - For the server - <span style={{color:'gray'}}>intents.otterize.com/server</span>=<span style={{color:'magenta'}}>server</span>-<span style={{color:'red'}}>otterize-tutorial-np</span>-<span style={{color:'green'}}>7e16db</span>
    - <span style={{color:'gray'}}>intents.otterize.com/server</span> - Label prefix for servers
    - <span style={{color:'magenta'}}>server</span> - Server pod name
    - <span style={{color:'red'}}>otterize-tutorial-np</span> - Server pod namespace (might be truncated)
    - <span style={{color:'green'}}>7e16db</span> - Hash for server pod name and and namespace
  - For the client - <span style={{color:'gray'}}>intents.otterize.com/access</span>-<span style={{color:'magenta'}}>server</span>-<span style={{color:'red'}}>otterize-tutorial-np</span>-<span style={{color:'green'}}>7e16db</span>=true
    - <span style={{color:'gray'}}>intents.otterize.com/access</span> - Label prefix for clients
    - <span style={{color:'magenta'}}>server</span> - Server pod name
    - <span style={{color:'red'}}>otterize-tutorial-np</span> - Server pod namespace (might be truncated)
    - <span style={{color:'green'}}>7e16db</span> - Hash for server pod name and and namespace
3. Finally, let's look at the namespace label with:
  ```bash
  kubectl get namespace otterize-tutorial-npol --show-labels
  ```
  You should see:
  ```bash
  NAME                     STATUS   AGE   LABELS
otterize-tutorial-npol   Active   36s   intents.otterize.com/namespace-name=otterize-tutorial-npol,kubernetes.io/metadata.name=otterize-tutorial-npol
  ```
  With the new label added by Otterize - **intents.otterize.com/namespace-name=otterize-tutorial-npol**
