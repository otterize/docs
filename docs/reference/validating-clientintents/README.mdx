Otterize's `ClientIntent` CRDs can be validated using [Kyverno](https://kyverno.io/#td-block-1).
Kyverno is a policy engine designed for Kubernetes
Kyverno policies can validate, mutate, generate, and cleanup Kubernetes resources, and verify image signatures and artifacts to help secure the software supply chain.

To install and setup Kyverno, follow the instructions in the [Kyverno documentation](https://kyverno.io/docs/installation/).

The following are some example Kyverno policies that can be used to validate `ClientIntent` CRDs:

* Validate that `ClientIntents` CRDs do not have any AWS `s3:DeleteAction` operations:
    ```yaml
    apiVersion: kyverno.io/v1
    kind: ClusterPolicy
    metadata:
      name: validate-clientintents
    spec:
      validationFailureAction: Enforce
      rules:
        - name: deny-s3-deleteobject
          match:
            any:
              - resources:
                  kinds:
                    - k8s.otterize.com/v1alpha3/ClientIntents
          validate:
            message: "s3:DeleteObject is not allowed"
            foreach:
              - list: request.object.spec.calls[]
                foreach:
                  - list: "element.awsActions"
                    deny:
                      conditions:
                        all:
                          - key: "{{element}}"
                            operator: Equals
                            value: "s3:DeleteAction"
    ```
