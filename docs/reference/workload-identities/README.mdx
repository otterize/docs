title: Workload identity and resolution
---
Otterize supports two approaches for specifying workload identity in Kubernetes: explicit and implicit.

## Explicitly specifying `Kind`
This approach requires specifying both the name, possibly with a namespace, and the kind of the workload in the intent, ensuring precise identification.
```yaml
   apiVersion: k8s.otterize.com/v2beta1
   kind: ClientIntents
   metadata:
     name: client
     namespace: otterize-tutorial-istio-mapping
   spec:
     workload:
       name: client
       kind: Deployment
     targets:
       - kubernetes:
           name: server.example-ns
           kind: Service
       # This is equivalent to the above target
       - service:
           name: server.example-ns
```
In the YAML above, the workload `client` is a `Deployment` in the namespace `otterize-tutorial-istio-mapping`, and it intends to call the workload `server`, which is a `Service`, in the namespace `example-ns`.


### Kubernetes workload identity resolution
How do Otterize operators decide what is the identity of the workload that runs within the pod? The algorithm is as follows:

1. If the pod has an `intents.otterize.com/workload-name` annotation, its value is used as the workload name. (You can change which annotation is used by setting `global.workloadNameOverrideAnnotationName` &mdash; see the [docs](/reference/otterize-chart#global-parameters).) This allows developers and
   automations to explicitly name workloads, if needed. The value must not contain a period `.` as a period is used to separate workload name and namespace, when the workload is from a different namespace: `server.namespace`.
2. If there is no `intents.otterize.com/workload-name` annotation, a recursive look-up is performed for the Kubernetes resource owner of
   the pod, until the root resource is reached, and its name is used as the workload name. For example, if you have
   a `Deployment` named `checkoutservice`, which then creates and owns a `ReplicaSet`, which then creates and owns
   a `Pod`, then the workload name for that pod is `checkoutservice` - same as the name of the `Deployment`. This is
   intended to capture the likely-more-meaningful "human name" of the workload. If the resulting workload name contains
   a period `.`, it is replaced with an underscore `_`. Periods are used in workload names to denote namespaces, e.g. `server.namespace`.
