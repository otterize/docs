title: "GitHub integration"
---

The Otterize GitHub integration watches a Kubernetes cluster for access that will be blocked because ClientIntents are missing, and automatically creates pull requests with updated ClientIntents.

## How to use
To add a GitHub integration, head to [Otterize Cloud](https://app.otterize.com), create a GitHub integration and follow the instructions.
When you add an integration, Otterize will check it periodically for blocked services and create pull requests with updated ClientIntents.

## Example
For example, let's say we have a cluster with the services from the NetworkPolicy automation tutorial:

Once we set up the GitHub integration and install the Otterize GitHub app on our repository, it will open a pull request with the correct ClientIntents:

After we review the pull request, let's merge it:

And now the service is unblocked and its connection becomes green in the access graph:
