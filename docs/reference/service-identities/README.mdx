title: Service identities and resolution
---

Otterize uses universal service identities to refer to services, regardless of which infrastructure they run on. Every service has a name, and possibly a namespace, which is specified in Otterize client intents to request access to other services.

## Kubernetes service identity resolution
How do Otterize operators decide what is the name of the service that runs within the pod? The algorithm is as follows:

1. If the pod has an `intents.otterize.com/service-name` annotation, its value is used as the service name. (You can change which annotation is used by setting `global.serviceNameOverrideAnnotationName` &mdash; see the [docs](/reference/configuration/otterize-chart#global-parameters).) This allows developers and
   automations to explicitly name services, if needed. The value must not contain a period `.` as a period is used to separate service name and namespace, when the service is from a different namespace: `svcname.namespace`.
2. If there is no `intents.otterize.com/service-name` annotation, a recursive look-up is performed for the Kubernetes resource owner of
   the pod, until the root resource is reached, and its name is used as the service name. For example, if you have
   a `Deployment` named `checkoutservice`, which then creates and owns a `ReplicaSet`, which then creates and owns
   a `Pod`, then the service name for that pod is `checkoutservice` - same as the name of the `Deployment`. This is
   intended to capture the likely-more-meaningful "human name" of the service. If the resulting service name contains
   a period `.`, it is replaced with an underscore `_`. Periods are used in service names to denote namespaces, e.g. `svcname.namespace`.
