With its Istio watcher enabled, the network mapper allows you to map pod-to-pod Istio traffic within your K8s cluster.

In this tutorial, we will:

- Install the Istio service mesh in our cluster.
- Deploy 2 clients calling a server (in this case, an nginx reverse-proxy) over HTTP using different paths.
- Map their calls using the network mapper and its Istio watcher component.

## Prerequisites

<details>
<summary>Prepare a Kubernetes cluster</summary>

Before you start, you'll need a Kubernetes cluster. Having a cluster with a [CNI](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/compute-storage-net/network-plugins/) that supports [NetworkPolicies](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/network-policies/) isn't required for this tutorial, but is recommended so that your cluster works with other tutorials.

{@include: ../../_common/cluster-setup.md}

</details>

You can now install Otterize in your cluster, and optionally connect to Otterize Cloud. Connecting to Cloud lets you:

1. See what's happening visually in your browser, through the "access graph";

So either forego browser visualization and:

<details>
<summary>Install the Otterize network mapper in your cluster with the Istio watcher component enabled, and <b>without</b> Otterize Cloud</summary>

{@include: ../../_common/install-otterize-istio-watcher.md}

</details>

Or choose to include browser visualization and:

<details>
<summary>Install Otterize in your cluster, <b>with</b> Otterize Cloud</summary>

#### Create an Otterize Cloud account

{@include: ../../_common/create-account.md}

#### Install Otterize OSS, connected to Otterize Cloud

{@include: ../../_common/install-otterize-from-cloud-with-enforcement-with-istiowatcher.md}

</details>

Finally, you'll need to install the Otterize CLI (if you haven't already) to interact with the network mapper:

<details>
<summary>Install the Otterize CLI</summary>

{@include: ../../_common/install-otterize-cli.md}

</details>

## Install and configure Istio

<details>
<summary>Install Istio in the cluster via Helm</summary>

{@include: ../../_common/install-istio.md}

</details>
<details>
<summary>Create a namespace for our demo application and label it for Istio injection</summary>

```shell
kubectl create namespace otterize-tutorial-istio-mapping
kubectl label namespace otterize-tutorial-istio-mapping istio-injection=enabled
```

</details>
<details>
<summary>Add HTTP methods and request paths to Istio exported metrics</summary>

Apply this configuration in the `istio-system` namespace, propagating it to all namespaces covered by the mesh.

```
kubectl apply -f ${ABSOLUTE_URL}/code-examples/network-mapper/istio-telemetry-enablement.yaml -n istio-system
```

```yaml
{@include: ../../../static/code-examples/network-mapper/istio-telemetry-enablement.yaml}
```

</details>

:::tip
HTTP request paths and methods aren't exported in Envoy's connection metrics by default, but we do want to capture those
details when creating the network map. That way we not only have better visibility of the calling patterns,
e.g. in the access graph, but we can also use that information to automatically generate fine-grained intents and
enforce them with Istio authorization policies.

## Deploy demo to simulate traffic

Let's add services and traffic to the cluster and see how the network mapper builds the map.
Deploy the following simple example &mdash; `client`, `client2` and `nginx`, communicating over HTTP:

```shell
kubectl apply -n otterize-tutorial-istio-mapping -f ${ABSOLUTE_URL}/code-examples/network-mapper/istio.yaml
```

## Map the cluster

The Istio watcher component of the network mapper starts querying Envoy sidecars for HTTP connections and builds an
in-memory network map as soon as it's installed. The Otterize CLI allows you to interact with the network mapper to
grab a snapshot of current mapped traffic, reset its state, and more.

For a complete list of the CLI capabilities read the [CLI command reference](/reference/cli/#network-mapper).

### Extract and see the network map

{@include: ../../getting-started/_show_mapped_istio_traffic_cli.mdx}

### Show the access graph in Otterize Cloud

If you've attached Otterize OSS to Otterize Cloud, you can now also see the [access graph in your browser](https://app.otterize.com):

![Access graph](/img/quick-tutorials/network-mapper/otterize-tutorial-access-graph-istio.png)

Note, for example, that the `client` &rightarrow; `nginx` arrow is yellow. Clicking on it shows:

<img
  src="/img/quick-tutorials/network-mapper/otterize-tutorial-access-graph-istio-edge-info.png"
  alt="Access graph edge info"
/>

The access graph reveals several types of information and insights, such as:

1. Seeing the network map for different clusters, seeing the subset of the map for a given namespace, or even &mdash; according to how you've mapped namespaces to environments &mdash; seeing the subset of the map for a specific environment.
2. Revealing detailed HTTP-level information about the calls being made (e.g. `GET` to `/client-path`), as reported by the Istio watcher.
3. Filtering the map to include recently-seen traffic, since some date in the past. That way you can eliminate calls that are no longer relevant, without having to reset the network mapper and start building a new map.
4. Showing more specifics about access, if the intents operator is also connected: understand which services are protected or would be protected, and which client calls are being blocked or would be blocked. We'll see more of that in the Istio AuthorizationPolicy tutorial.

## What's next

The network mapper is a great way to bootstrap IBAC. It generates client intents files that reflect
the current topology of your services; those can then be used by each client team to grant them easy
and _secure_ access to the services they need, and as their needs evolve, they need only evolve
the intents files. We'll see more of that below.

Where to go next?

- Learn how to roll out [Istio authorization-policy-based access control](/quickstart/access-control/k8s-istio-authorization-policies) using intents.
- If you haven't already, see the [automate network policies tutorial](/quickstart/access-control/k8s-network-policies).
- Or go to the next tutorial to [automate secure access for Kafka](/quickstart/access-control/k8s-kafka-mtls).

### Teardown

To remove Istio and the deployed examples run:

```bash
helm uninstall istio-base -n istio-system
helm uninstall istiod -n istio-system
kubectl delete namespace otterize-tutorial-istio-mapping
```
