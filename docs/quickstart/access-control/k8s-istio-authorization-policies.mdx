Otterize automates mTLS-based, HTTP-level pod-to-pod access control with Istio authorization (authZ) policies, within your Kubernetes cluster.

Implementing this kind of access control with Istio is complicated. For example, authorization policies select servers by label, and clients by service account, so both of those need to be created or updated.

To help you avoid manually managing complicated authorization policies per server, Otterize implements **intent-based access control** (IBAC).
You just declare what calls the client pods intend to make,
and everything is automatically wired together so only intended calls are allowed.

In this tutorial, we will:

- Deploy an Istio demo application with two client pods and one server pod.
- Declare that the first client intends to call the server with a specific HTTP path and method.
- See that an Istio authorization policy was autogenerated to allow just that, and to block the (undeclared) calls from the other client.

## Prerequisites

<details>
<summary>Prepare a Kubernetes cluster</summary>

Before you start, you'll need a Kubernetes cluster. Having a cluster with a [CNI](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/compute-storage-net/network-plugins/) that supports [NetworkPolicies](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/network-policies/) isn't required for this tutorial, but is recommended so that your cluster works with other tutorials.

{@include: ../../_common/cluster-setup.md}

</details>

You can now install (or reinstall) Otterize in your cluster, and optionally connect to Otterize Cloud. Connecting to Cloud lets you:

1. See what's happening visually in your browser, through the "access graph";

So either forego browser visualization and:

<details>
<summary>Install Otterize in your cluster, <b>without</b> Otterize Cloud</summary>

{@include: ../../_common/install-otterize-istio-enabled.md}

</details>

Or choose to include browser visualization and:

<details>
<summary>Install Otterize in your cluster, <b>with</b> Otterize Cloud</summary>

#### Create an Otterize Cloud account

{@include: ../../_common/create-account.md}

#### Install Otterize OSS, connected to Otterize Cloud

{@include: ../../_common/install-otterize-from-cloud-with-istio-enforcement.md}

</details>

## Install and configure Istio

<details>
<summary>Install Istio in the cluster via Helm</summary>

{@include: ../../_common/install-istio.md}

</details>
<details>
<summary>Add HTTP methods and request paths to Istio exported metrics</summary>

Apply this configuration in the `istio-system` namespace, propagating it to all namespaces covered by the mesh.

```
kubectl apply -f ${ABSOLUTE_URL}/code-examples/network-mapper/istio-telemetry-enablement.yaml -n istio-system
```

```yaml
{@include: ../../../static/code-examples/network-mapper/istio-telemetry-enablement.yaml}
```

</details>

:::tip
HTTP request paths and methods aren't exported in Envoy's connection metrics by default, but we do want to capture those
details when creating the network map. That way we not only have better visibility of the calling patterns,
e.g. in the access graph, but we can also use that information to automatically generate fine-grained intents and
enforce them with Istio authorization policies.
:::

## Deploy the two clients and the server

Deploy a simple example consisting of `client` and `other-client` calling `nginx` over HTTP:

```shell
kubectl apply -n otterize-tutorial-istio -f ${ABSOLUTE_URL}/code-examples/istio-authorization-policies/all.yaml
```

## Apply intents

We will now declare that the **client** intends to call the **server** at a particular HTTP path using a specific HTTP method.

When the intents YAML is applied, creating a custom resource of type `ClientIntents`,
Otterize will add an Istio authorization policy to allow the intended call
(**client** &rarr; **server** with the declared path and method) and block all unintended calls (e.g., **client-other** &rarr; **server**).

1. Here is the `intents.yaml` declaration of the client, which we will apply below:

```yaml
{@include: ../../../static/code-examples/istio-authorization-policies/intents.yaml}
```

To apply it, use:
```shell
kubectl apply -n otterize-tutorial-istio -f ${ABSOLUTE_URL}/code-examples/istio-authorization-policies/intents.yaml
```
### See it in action

<details>
<summary>Optional: check deployment status</summary>
Check that the client and server pods were deployed

```bash
kubectl get pods -n otterize-tutorial-istio
```

You should see

```
NAME                           READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
client-68b775f766-749r4         2/2     Running   0          32s
nginx-c646898-2lq7l             2/2     Running   0          32s
other-client-74cc54f7b5-9rctd   2/2     Running   0          32s
```

</details>

monitor both client attempts to call the server with additional terminal windows,
so we can see the effects of our changes in real time.

2. **Open a new terminal window [client]** and tail the client log:

```bash
kubectl logs -f --tail 1 -n otterize-tutorial-istio deploy/client
```

<details>
<summary>Expected output</summary>

At this point the client should be able to communicate with the server:

```
Calling server...
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
...
hello from /client-path
```

</details>

3. **Open another terminal window [client-other]** and tail the other-client log:

```bash
kubectl logs -f --tail 1 -n otterize-tutorial-istio deploy/other-client
```

<details>
<summary>Expected output</summary>

At this point the client should be able to communicate with the server:

```
Calling server...
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
...
hello from /other-client-path
```

</details>

Keep an eye on the logs being tailed in the **[other-client]** terminal window,
and apply this `intents.yaml` file in your **main terminal window** using:

```shell
kubectl apply -f ${ABSOLUTE_URL}/code-examples/istio-authorization-policies/intents.yaml
```

:::tip
Client intents are the cornerstone of [intent-based access control (IBAC)](https://otterize.com/ibac).
::: 2. You should quickly see in the **[other-client]** terminal that it times out when calling the server,
as expected since it didn't declare its intents:

```bash
Calling server...
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
...
hello from /other-client-path  # <- before applying the intents file
# highlight-start
Calling server...              # <- after applying the intents file
curl timed out
Terminated
# highlight-end
```

3. And in the **[client]** terminal you should see that calls go through, as expected since they were declared:

```bash
Calling server...
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
...
hello from /client-path
```

4. You should also see that a new Istio authorization policy was created:

```bash
kubectl get authorizationpolicies.security.istio.io -n otterize-tutorial-istio
```

This should return:

```
NAME                                                                AGE
authorization-policy-to-nginx-from-client.otterize-tutorial-istio   6s
```

If you've attached Otterize OSS to Otterize Cloud, go back to see the [access graph in your browser](https://app.otterize.com):

![Access graph](/img/quick-tutorials/k8s-istio-authorization-policies/protected.png)

And upon clicking the green arrow:
![Access graph](/img/quick-tutorials/k8s-istio-authorization-policies/protected-edge.png)

It's now clear what happened:

1. The server is now protected, and is also blocking some of its clients.
2. Calls from **[client]** &rarr; **[nginx]** are declared and therefore allowed (green arrow).
3. Calls from **[client-other]** &rarr; **[nginx]** are not declared and therefore blocked (red arrow). Click on the arrow to see what to do about it.

:::tip Done!
Otterize did its job of both protecting the server _and_ allowing intended access.
:::

## What did we accomplish?

- Controlling access through Istio authorization policies no longer means touching authorization policies at all.

- The server is now protected, and can be accessed only by clients which declared their intents, authenticated via mTLS connection with specific certificates.

- Clients simply declare what they need to access with their intents files.

- The next `kubectl apply` ensures that authorization policies automatically reflect the most recent intended pod-to-pod access.

<details>
<summary>Expand to see what happened behind the scenes</summary>

Otterize generated a specific Istio authorization policy on the ingress of the pod of the server, allowing the server to
be accessed by the pod of the client, based on that client's declared intent. Otterize uses labels to define the authorization policy and associate it
with a server in a namespace, and uses service accounts to identify clients, as Istio requires. This happens as follows:

1. The server's pod is given a label `intents.otterize.com/server` whose value uniquely represents that server.
   The Istio authorization policy stipulates that it applies to the ingress of server pods with this label.
2. The client's service account is looked up through its pod, and used in the policy.
   The authorization policy stipulates that only services with this service account can access the server.
   In the event that the service account is shared by multiple services, an Event is placed on the `ClientIntent` to warn about this, which is also picked up as a warning in Otterize Cloud, if connected.

Otterize saved us from doing all this work: by simply declaring the client's intents in `intents.yaml`,
all the appropriate configuration was managed automatically behind the scenes.

:::tip Bonus tutorial
Try to create an intents file yourself for **client-other**, and apply it to allow this other client to call the server.

## What's next

- Get started with the [Otterize network mapper for Istio](/quickstart/visualization/k8s-istio-watcher) to help you bootstrap intents files with HTTP resources
  for use in [intent-based access control (IBAC)](https://otterize.com/ibac).

## Teardown

To remove Istio and the deployed examples run:

```bash
helm uninstall istio-base -n istio-system
kubectl delete namespace otterize-tutorial-istio
```
