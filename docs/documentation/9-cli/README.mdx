title: CLI command reference
---

The following are the commands offered by the Otterize command line interface (CLI).

This CLI is open-source software. To see its source, and to download binaries or build it yourself,
see [https://github.com/otterize/otterize-cli](https://github.com/otterize/otterize-cli).

## Command structure

Most CLI commands are of the form `otterize OBJECT ACTION`. Because there are multiple objects
which each have multiple operations, this order makes the auto-completion and documentation built into the CLI
easy to access on the fly.

- `otterize -h` or `otterize --help` offers help on the various objects
- `otterize OBJECT -h` or `otterize OBJECT --help` offers help on the specified object
- `otterize OBJECT OPERATION -h` or `otterize OBJECT OPERATION --help` offers help on the specified operation

`otterize completion` offers instruction for generating command completions in various shells.
