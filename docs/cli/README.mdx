The Otterize command line interface (CLI) offers the following capabilities:
- Interact with the [Otterize network mapper](/quick-tutorials/k8s-network-mapper).
- Transform [intents files](/intents-and-intents-files/#intents-file-formats) from plain YAML format to Kubernetes custom resource YAML format.
- (Coming soon) Interact with the Otterize Cloud, through its API.

This CLI is open-source software. To see its source or build it yourself,
see [https://github.com/otterize/otterize-cli](https://github.com/otterize/otterize-cli).

The CLI is available as an installable binary as documented in this [guide](/k8s-installation/#install-the-otterize-cli).

The following are the commands offered by the Otterize CLI.

## Command structure

Most CLI commands are of the form `otterize OBJECT ACTION`. Because there are multiple objects
which each have multiple operations, this order makes the auto-completion and documentation built into the CLI
easy to access on the fly.

- `otterize -h` or `otterize --help` offers help on the various objects
- `otterize OBJECT -h` or `otterize OBJECT --help` offers help on the specified object
- `otterize OBJECT OPERATION -h` or `otterize OBJECT OPERATION --help` offers help on the specified operation

`otterize completion` offers instruction for generating command completions in various shells.

## Intents

### `otterize intents convert [-f PATH]`

Convert client intents files in plain YAML format to Kubernetes ClientIntents resource format.

#### Options

| Name | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `-f` or `--filename` | `'.'` | The client intents filename, or a directory containing client intents files. |

#### Returns

Here's the result of converting a directory containing two client intents file in plain YAML format.
The result is YAML describing two Kubernetes resources separated with the YAML `---` separator.

```shell
apiVersion: k8s.otterize.com/v1alpha1
kind: ClientIntents
metadata:
  name: cartservice
  namespace: otterize-ecom-demo
spec:
  service:
    name: cartservice
  calls:
    - name: redis-cart
      type: http
---
apiVersion: k8s.otterize.com/v1alpha1
kind: ClientIntents
metadata:
  name: checkoutservice
  namespace: otterize-ecom-demo
spec:
  service:
    name: checkoutservice
  calls:
    - name: cartservice
      type: http
    - name: currencyservice
      type: http
```

## Network mapper

All `otterize mapper` commands share a set of optional flags which will not be repeated in the documentation
for each command.

#### Common options

| Name | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `--mapper-namespace` | `otterize-system` | Specifies the namespace where the mapper service was installed. |
| `--mapper-service-name` | `otterize-network-mapper` | Specifies the name of the mapper service as it was installed. |
| `--mapper-service-name` | `otterize-service-port` | Specifies the port on which the mapper service is listening. |


### `otterize mapper reset`

as a list of clients and the servers they call.

#### Options

| Name | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `-n` or `--namespaces` |  | Export only clients in these namespaces (comma-separated) |

#### Returns

Here's a partial output from `otterize mapper list -n otterize-ecom-demo`:

```shell
cartservice in namespace otterize-ecom-demo calls:
  - redis-cart
checkoutservice in namespace otterize-ecom-demo calls:
  - cartservice
  - currencyservice
  - emailservice
  - paymentservice
  - productcatalogservice
  - shippingservice
frontend in namespace otterize-ecom-demo calls:
  - adservice
  - cartservice
  - checkoutservice
  - currencyservice
  - productcatalogservice
  - recommendationservice
  - shippingservice
loadgenerator in namespace otterize-ecom-demo calls:
  - frontend
recommendationservice in namespace otterize-ecom-demo calls:
  - productcatalogservice
```

### `otterize mapper export`

Return the network map built by the network mapper since it started, or since it was reset,
as [client intents file(s)](/intents-and-intents-files/#intents-file-formats) in various formats.

#### Options

| `-n` or `--namespaces` |  | Export only clients in these namespaces (comma-separated) |
| `-o` or `--output` | `STDOUT` | Filename or directory for redirecting the output |
| `--output-type` | `single-file` | Whether the output should be written as a single file (`single-file`) or as multiple files in a directory (`dir`). Requires the `-o` or `--output` to point to a directory. |

#### Returns

Here's a partial output from `otterize mapper export -n otterize-ecom-demo`:

```shell
apiVersion: k8s.otterize.com/v1alpha1
kind: ClientIntents
metadata:
  name: cartservice
  namespace: otterize-ecom-demo
