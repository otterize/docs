The Network Mapper allows you to map pod-to-pod traffic within your K8s cluster. This tutorial will guide you
through installing Otterize, mapping traffic and tracking changes.

## Install the network mapper

{@include: ../_common/install-otterize-network-mapper.md}

## Install the Otterize CLI

{@include: ../_common/install-otterize-cli.md}

## How to

### Show mapped traffic

{@include: ../_common/network-mapper/intents-list-export.md}

### Change traffic -> Sniff&Diff

One of the benefits for using the network mapper is the ability to track changes over time for communication within your
cluster.

1. Let's save the current state of traffic from the cluster into a file we will compare against later:
   ```shell
   otterize mapper list > intents-original.txt
   ```

2. And now we can add traffic to the cluster and see how the network mapper tracks it. You can do that by deploying our
   example
   which consists of two pods: client and server, communicating over HTTP. Deploy example:
   ```shell
   kubectl apply -n otterize-tutorial-mapper -f https://docs.otterize.com/code-examples/network-mapper/all.yaml
   ```

<details>
<summary>Check that the client and server pods were deployed</summary>

```bash
kubectl get pods -n otterize-tutorial-mapper
```
You should see
```
NAME                      READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
client-756f7677f8-d6qdq   1/1     Running   0          45s
server-6698c58cbc-ssxvx   1/1     Running   0          45s
```
</details>

3. Export the updated observed intents:
   ```shell
   otterize mapper list
   ```
   You will now see the client and server pods communication in addition
   to the previously observed traffic.
   ```shell
   # highlight-start
   client calls:
     - server
   # highlight-end
   
   checkoutservice in namespace ecom-demo calls:
     - orderservice
   
   orderservice in namespace ecom-demo calls:
     - kafka
   ```
5. We can also compare both outputs to see the difference. We'll start by saving the updated state to a file with:
   ```bash
   otterize mapper list > intents-updated.txt
   ```
6. And compare the original file with the updated file using:
   ```bash
   diff --color=always -y intents-original.txt intents-updated.txt;echo
   ```
   You should see a result looking like:
   ```bash
                                                       > client in namespace otterize-tutorial-mapper calls:
                                                       >   - server
                                                       >
   checkoutservice in namespace ecom-demo calls:       checkoutservice in namespace ecom-demo calls:
     - orderservice                                      - orderservice

   orderservice in namespace ecom-demo calls:          orderservice in namespace ecom-demo calls:
     - kafka                                             - kafka
      ```

## What's next

Now that we've observed cluster intents we can enforce them with the intents operator.

- Configure [network policies](/quick-tutorials/k8s-network-policies).
- Configure [secure access for Kafka](/quick-tutorials/kafka-mtls).

### Teardown

To remove the deployed resources run:

```bash
kubectl delete namespace otterize-tutorial-mapper
helm network-mapper uninstall -n otterize-system
```
