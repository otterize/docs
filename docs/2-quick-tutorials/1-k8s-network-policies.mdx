Otterize automates network policies within your cluster by abstracting away
the management of pod identities, the labeling of clients, servers and namespaces,
and the manual authoring of individual network policies.

With intent-based access control, you just declare what client calls will be needed,
and everything is automatically wired together so only intended calls are allowed.

In this tutorial, we will:

- Install Otterize in your Kubernetes cluster.
- Make sure your Kubernetes cluster has a CNI network plugin that handles network policies
- Deploy a server pod, and a client pod that calls it
- Deploy a "default deny" network policy to block undeclared calls
- Declare that the client pod intends to call the server pod
- See that a network policy was autogenerated to allow just that

## Install Otterize

:::note
You can skip this section if Otterize is already installed in your cluster.
:::

{@include: ../_common/install-otterize.md}

## Make sure you have a CNI network plugin

{@include: ../_common/verify-cni.md}

If you're not sure whether your cluster's CNI plugin supports network policies, you can just continue &mdash; it'll soon become clear ;-).

## Deploy the server, client, and default network policy

Our simple example consists of two pods: an HTTP server and a client that calls it.

We also deploy a default-deny ingress network policy,
blocking pods from accepting incoming calls unless another network policy explicitly allows them.

   ```yaml
   {@include: ../../static/code-examples/network-policies/default-deny-network-policy.yaml}
   ```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>
</details>

Deploy the client, server, and the default deny network policy using `kubectl`.

   ```shell
   kubectl apply -f https://docs.otterize.com/code-examples/network-policies/all.yaml
   ```

<details>
<summary>Optional: check deployment status</summary>
Check that the client and server pods were deployed

```bash
kubectl get pods -n otterize-tutorial-npol
```
You should see
```
NAME                      READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
client-5689997b5c-grlnt   1/1     Running   0          35s
server-6698c58cbc-v9n9b   1/1     Running   0          34s
```
Check that the default deny ingress network policy was deployed:

```bash
kubectl get NetworkPolicies -n otterize-tutorial-npol
```
You should see
```
NAME                   POD-SELECTOR   AGE
default-deny-ingress   none           17s
```
</details>
Let's monitor the client's attempts to call the server with a second terminal window,
   so we can see the effects of our changes in real time.

   **Open a second terminal window** and tail the client log:
   ```bash
   kubectl logs -f --tail 1 -n otterize-tutorial-npol deploy/client
   ```
   At this point the client should be timing out when trying to call the server:
   ```
   Calling server...
   curl timed out
   Calling server...
   curl timed out
   Calling server...
   curl timed out
   ```

:::tip
   If the client isn't timing out, then the installed CNI plugin likely does not support network policies.
   Consult the docs for your Kubernetes distribution or head back to the [Calico installation section](#make-sure-you-have-a-cni-network-plugin) to install one.
   For example, minikube does not start by default with a CNI that supports network policies
   but you can ask it to start with one that does, such as Calico.
:::

   The client failing like that is the expected outcome since by default all pods' ingress are blocked by the default network policy:
```yaml
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: NetworkPolicy
metadata:
  name: default-deny-ingress
  namespace:  otterize-tutorial-npol
spec:
  podSelector: {} # selects all pods in the namespace
  # the lack of a `from` field means no pod is allowed to access
  policyTypes: # this policy applies to ingress and doesn't apply to egress
    - Ingress
```
   Once the client declares its intents, Otterize will add a network policy to allow the intended calls.
   Let's see that now.

## Apply intents

1. The client declares its intent to call the server with this `intents.yaml` file:

   ```yaml
   {@include: ../../static/code-examples/network-policies/intents.yaml}
   ```
:::tip
Client intents are the cornerstone of [intent-based access control](https://otterize.com/ibac).
:::

   Keep an eye on the logs being tailed in the **second terminal window**
   while you apply this `intents.yaml` file in your **main terminal window** using:
   ```shell
   kubectl apply -f https://docs.otterize.com/code-examples/network-policies/intents.yaml
   ```
2. You should quickly see in the **second terminal** that the client is now successfully calling the server:
   ```bash
   Calling server...
   curl timed out
   Calling server...
   curl timed out                              # <- before applying the intents file
   # highlight-start
   Calling server...                           # <- after applying the intents file
   HTTP/1.1 200 OK
   X-App-Name: http-echo
   X-App-Version: 0.2.3

   Content-Length: 12
   Content-Type: text/plain; charset=utf-8
   
   Hi, I am the server, you called, may I help you?
   # highlight-end
   ```

3. You should see that a new network policy was created:
   ```bash
   kubectl get NetworkPolicies -n otterize-tutorial-npol
   ```
   will output:
   ```
   NAME                                           POD-SELECTOR                                         AGE
   access-to-server-from-otterize-tutorial-npol   otterize/server=server-otterize-tutorial-np-7e16db   6s
   default-deny-ingress                           <none>                                               28s
   ```

<details>
<summary>Expand to see what happened behind the scenes</summary>

To generate network policies between two pods, for example called `client` and `server` running in
namespace `otterize-tutorial-npol` we needed to (in a simplified form):

1. Label the `server` pod with `otterize/server` and a unique value that represents this server - we will use this label in the network policy to apply it to all pods with
   this label (as an ingress rule).
2. Label the `client` pod with `otterize/access-to-server`, saying that this specific pod has access to `server` - we will
   use this label in the network policy as a filter &mdash; every
   pod that has the label saying [this pod can access the server] will be able to pass through the network policy.
3. Label the `client`'s namespace `otterize/namespace-name` with value `otterize-tutorial-npol` &mdash; this is used when intents refer to services in other namespaces.
4. Generate a network policy saying that
    1. Only pod with the label `otterize/access-to-server`
    2. From the namespaces with the label `otterize/namespace-name` and value `otterize-tutorial-npol`
    3. Can access pods with the label `otterize/server` and that matches this server

Otterize saved us from doing all this work by simply declaring the client's intents in `intents.yaml`,
while the appropriate network policies were managed automatically behind the scenes.

You can read the detailed explanation about how Otterize manages labels for network policies [here](/guides/k8s-ibac-via-network-policies/deeper-dive#track-artifacts).

## What's next

- Configure [network policies](/guides/k8s-ibac-via-network-policies/) for your existing deployments.
- Explore the [network mapper](/quick-tutorials/k8s-network-mapper) to help you bootstrap intents you can.
  apply as network policies.

## Teardown

To remove the deployed resources run:

```bash
kubectl delete namespace otterize-tutorial-npol
